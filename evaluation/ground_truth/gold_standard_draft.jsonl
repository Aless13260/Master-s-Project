This reflects our ongoing cost reduction efforts, the continued production ramp success in Berlin and Texas and the strong performance of our Energy and Services & Other businesses. Our commitment to being at the forefront of AI development entered a new chapter with the start of production of Dojo training computers. We are hopeful that our immense neural net training needs will be satisfied using our in-house designed Dojo hardware. The better the neural net training capacity, the greater the opportunity for our Autopilot team to iterate on new solutions. In conclusion, we are focusing on cost reduction, new product development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow.

As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since the 2012 CEO Performance\nAward was last earned in 2017. Despite overwhelming support from you in 2018 and again in 2024, our legal efforts continue in the Delaware\ncourts to reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Despite these legal challenges, we can all agree that Elon has delivered the transformative\nand unprecedented growth that was required to earn all milestones of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This growth has translated into immense\nvalue generated for Tesla and all our shareholders.\nTo recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value\nhe delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018. After all, “a\ndeal is a deal.” Thus, as evidence that Tesla is committed to honoring its promises in the 2018 CEO Performance Award and intends\nto compensate its CEO for his future services commensurate with his contributions to our company and shareholders, we have recommended\nthis award as a first step, “good faith” payment to Elon.\nDelaware litigation continues to loom over us after seven years.\nAs we told you last year, the 2018 CEO Performance Award resulted in\na $2.3 billion stock-based compensation charge to Tesla but brought about $735 billion of increased market capitalization. Despite delivering\nsuch extraordinary returns, that award continues to be in legal limbo despite two separate shareholder votes supporting it by large margins.\nFurthermore, we have no clear timeline for resolution, as we are still waiting not only for a ruling, but a hearing date to be heard in\nfront of the Delaware Supreme Court.

We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nWe also announced actions to optimize our global office space and our expectation that we would incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of the severance and office space exit charges will be included within Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs.\nYou will see a tabular disclosure of these charges in our upcoming first quarter 2023 Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings press release in the following format:\nSeverance and Related\nOffice Space\nTotal\nCost of revenues\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal charges\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nii.\nChanges in useful lives of server and network equipment\nIn January 2023 we\ncompleted an asse", "gold_standard_guidance": [{"guid": "32223f0b166b4ba8b5813e59d0228cca", "company": "GOOGL", "guidance_type": "opex", "metric_name": "exit costs relating to office space reductions", "reporting_period": "Q1 FY2023", "current_value": null, "unit": "billion", "guided_range_low": 0.5, "guided_range_high": null, "is_revision": null, "revision_direction": null, "qualitative_direction": null, "rationales": "actions to optimize our global office space", "source_url": null, "source_type": "8-K", "published_at": null, "ingested_at": null, "extracted_at": "2025-12-17T02:59:19.049645+00:00", "processing_duration_seconds": 11.443059802055359, "extraction_method": "standard", "agentic_review_comment": null, "was_updated_by_agent": false, "sentiment_label": null, "sentiment_score": null, "risk_factors": null, "original_period_text": "Q1 2023"}, {"guid": "a1dd635c83874238b9d3e5f91fb7687f", "company": "GOOGL", "guidance_type": "opex", "metric_name": "depreciation expense", "reporting_period": "FY2023", "current_value": null, "unit": "billion", "guided_range_low": 3.4, "guided_range_high": null, "is_revision": null, "revision_direction": null, "qualitative_direction": "reduction", "rationales": "change in estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment to six years", "source_url": null, "source_type": "8-K", "published_at": null, "ingested_at": null, "extracted_at": "2025-12-17T02:59:19.050268+00:00", "processing_duration_seconds": 11.443059802055359, "extraction_method": "standard", "agentic_review_comment": null, "was_updated_by_agent": false, "sentiment_label": null, "sentiment_score": null, "risk_factors": null}], "manual_verification_status": "verified", "manual_notes": "", "published_at": "2023-04-20T16:24:04-04:00"}

Tayloe Stansbury, Intuit Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. “Our TurboTax Online customers were served entirely from AWS during the latter part of this tax season, and we expect to finish transitioning QuickBooks Online this year.  Now that most of our core applications are in AWS, the time is right to transition the ownership and operation of this data center to a team who will expertly manage the infrastructure through the remainder of this transition.”\nIntuit was one of the first companies of scale with enterprise-class data to move to the public cloud.  With the data center sale complete, Intuit will continue to leverage the public cloud’s scalable and reliable service to ultimately deliver better outcomes for customers.\nExpected Impact to Financials\nThe sale is expected to result in a GAAP operating loss of $75 to $85 million. The impact of this GAAP operating loss on net income and EPS is expected to be offset by tax benefits related to the sale, share based compensation and the reorganization of a subsidiary during the quarter.\nThe net impact is expected to result in no change to GAAP Earnings per Share (EPS).\nForward-looking Guidance\nIntuit revised GAAP operating income guidance and reiterated revenue, non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018, which ends July 31.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company now expects:\n•\nRevenue of $940 million to $960 million, growth of 12 to 14 percent.\n•\nGAAP operating loss of $100 million to $110 million.\n•\nNon-GAAP operating income of $75 million to $85 million.\n•\nGAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.04 to $0.06.\n•\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 to $0.24.\nFor the full fiscal year 2018, the company now expects:\n•\nRevenue of $5.915 billion to $5.935 billion, growth of 14 to 15 percent.\n•\nGAAP operating income of $1.465 billion to $1.475 billion, growth of 5 to 6 percent.\n•\nNon-GAAP operating income of $1.950 billion to $1.960 billion, growth of 12 to 13 percent.\n•\nGAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.52, growth of 21 to 22 percent.\n•\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51 to $5.53, growth of 25 percent.\nAbout Intuit\nIntuit’s mission is to Power Prosperity Around the World.

We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. Search delivered double-digit revenue growth, and our new features, like AI Overviews and AI Mode, are performing well. We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions offerings. And Cloud had strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run-rate is now more than $50 billion.

We also recognized our second- highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting  emissions requirements. Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle5 came down to its lowest level ever at ~$35,100.  In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to  make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile  competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering  of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the  first half of 2025. At our \"We, Robot\" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal  of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car  ownership and even public transit. The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin.  Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and  Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to  ramp Powerwall 3. Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments,  we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and  making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts  will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $113-118 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $114-119 billion.\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64-72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $60-65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. The European Commission (EC) recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025. We will appeal the EC's DMA decision but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

(NYSE: LOW) today reported net earnings of $1.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the quarter ended Nov. 1, 2019, which included non-cash pre-tax charges of $53 million further described below, compared to net earnings of $629 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 in the third quarter of 2018.  Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share\n1\nincreased 35.6 percent to $1.41 from adjusted diluted earnings per share\n1\nof $1.04 in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe $53 million non-cash pre-tax charges referenced above resulted from the company initiating a strategic review of its Canadian operations during the third quarter.  This review led to long-lived asset impairments and a change to the Canadian leadership team in the third quarter.  Based on the findings of the strategic review, in the fourth quarter, the company decided to take the following actions to improve future sales performance and profitability:\n•\nClose 34 underperforming stores in Canada;\n•\nUndertake a process to simplify multiple Canadian store banners to drive efficiency and reduce operational complexity;\n•\nReorganize the corporate support structure across Canada to more efficiently serve stores; and\n•\nRationalize the product assortment across the simplified Canadian store banners, to present a more coordinated assortment to the customer.\nAdditional pre-tax operating costs and charges of $175 to $225 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and other costs are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019, and have been reflected in the Company’s updated GAAP business outlook.\nSales for the third quarter were $17.4 billion and consolidated comparable sales increased 2.2 percent.  Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 3.0 percent.\n“We were pleased with the performance of our U.S. home improvement stores, which reflects a solid macroeconomic backdrop and continued progress in our transformation driven by investments in customer experience, improved merchandise category performance, and continued growth of our Pro business.  Due to improved execution, we delivered strong earnings per share growth, and as a result, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income guidance for 2019,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO.\n“Although we still have work to do, I am confident we are on the right path to build a better Lowe’s and generate long-term profitable growth.  We are committed to the Canadian market and are taking decisive action to improve the performance and profitability of our Canadian operations. We also have a detailed roadmap and a very experienced team in place to repair our Lowes.com business.  As we enter the fourth quarter, we are building strong momentum in the U.S. and are well positioned to deliver strong topline performance, while also driving margin improvement and operational efficiency.  We are excited about the progress we’ve made and the opportunity that lies ahead.  I would like to thank our associates for their commitment and dedication to serving our customers and communities,” added Ellison.\n1\nAdjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section of this release for additional information as well as a reconciliation between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\nDelivering on its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $835 million of stock under its share repurchase program and paid $428 million in dividends in the third quarter.\nAs of Nov. 1, 2019, Lowe’s operated 2,004 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada representing 208.9 million square feet of retail selling space.\nA conference call to discuss third quarter 2019 operating results is scheduled for today (Wednesday, Nov. 20) at 9:00 am ET.

Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“YoY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience.\nWe continue to have the broadest retail selection\n, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\nBeing sharp on price is always important\n, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records\n. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances,\nhelping lower our cost to serve\n. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). More selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond),\nwe’re not done lowering our cost to serve\n. We’ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’s more upside for us.\nInternationally\n, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to\n​\nexpand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\nAlongside our Stores business,\nAmazon’s Advertising progress remains strong\n, growing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 ...", "gold_standard_guidance": [], "manual_verification_status": "verified", "manual_notes": ""}

(NYSE: LOW) today reported net earnings of $509 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2020, which included pre-tax operating costs and charges of $185 million further described below, compared to a net loss of $824 million and diluted loss per share of ($1.03) in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share\n1\nincreased 17.5 percent to $0.94 from adjusted diluted earnings per share\n1\nof $0.80 in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe pre-tax operating costs and charges referenced above resulted from the company’s previously disclosed strategic review of its Canadian operations and closure of its Mexico business, resulting in pre-tax operating costs and charges of $185 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and other costs.\nSales for the fourth quarter were $16.0 billion compared to $15.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, and comparable sales increased 2.5 percent.  Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 2.6 percent for the fourth quarter.\n“In the fourth quarter, we delivered profitability that exceeded our expectations given strong expense management, improving gross margin and enhanced process execution.  Our sales growth was driven almost entirely by our U.S. brick and mortar stores, supported by our investments in technology, store environment and the Pro business.  We have a detailed road map in place to modernize our e-commerce platform and accelerate Lowes.com sales, which combined with the sales productivity improvement in our physical stores, underscores our opportunity to unlock additional growth,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO.\n“Though we are only one year into a multi-year plan, we made significant progress transforming our company and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on solid demand in a healthy home improvement market.  We are entering 2020 from a position of strength and remain confident that our focus on retail fundamentals combined with technology improvements will continue to pay dividends across the business.  I would like to thank all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving customers,” added Ellison.\n1\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section of this release for additional information as well as reconciliations between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\nDelivering on its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $670 million of stock under its share repurchase program and paid $423 million in dividends in the fourth quarter.\nAs of Jan 31, 2020, Lowe’s operated 1,977 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada representing 208.2 million square feet of retail selling space.\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2019 operating results is scheduled for today (Wednesday, Feb. 26) at 9:00 am ET.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing an outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $113-118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year.\nWhile we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate.\nWe currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\nWith the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years.

Despite the pandemic, it was a year of significant growth, progress on important innovations and investment for Edwards.  Fourth quarter sales increased 13 percent even as Omicron had a pronounced impact on hospital resources in December,” said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO.  “We are optimistic about prospects for continued strong sales growth in 2022, while we also invest in our groundbreaking portfolio of therapies.  We look forward to benefiting more patients by achieving strategic milestones, including new product launches and progress on pivotal clinical trials.”\n2021 Full Year Results\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2021, were $5.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19 percent, or 18 percent on an underlying basis.  Diluted earnings per share for 2021 were $2.38, while adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 increased 19 percent from the year-ago period.\nTranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)\nFor the quarter, the company reported TAVR sales of $872 million, a year-over-year increase of 12 percent, or 13 percent on an underlying basis.  TAVR sales were negatively impacted in the last several\nweeks of the fourth quarter due to the impact Omicron had on hospital resources in the U.S.\nGlobally, the company's average selling prices and market position were stable.\nOutside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards' underlying TAVR sales grew approximately 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, and the company continues to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR.\nEdwards took steps in the fourth quarter to support further TAVR therapy expansion, including completing enrollment of the EARLY TAVR Trial, a pioneering pivotal trial studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before symptoms develop.\nSeparately, the company received FDA approval to use the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve with the Alterra adaptive prestent for younger patients with pulmonary valve conditions.\nThe company continues to estimate that the global TAVR opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, implying a low double-digit compounded annual growth rate.\nTranscatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT)\nEdwards advanced pivotal trial enrollment across the company’s groundbreaking portfolio of technologies to support patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\nThe company completed enrollment of the CLASP IID pivotal trial and remains on track for U.S. approval late this year of the PASCAL platform for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation.\nFourth quarter TMTT sales were $25 million, lifted by continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe.  For the full year, TMTT sales doubled over the prior year, to $86 million.\nEdwards anticipates that the global TMTT opportunity will reach $5 billion by 2028.\nThe company remains committed to transforming the treatment of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease around the world.\nSurgical Structural Heart and Critical Care\nSurgical Structural Heart sales for the quarter were $221 million, up 8 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, or 9 percent on an underlying basis.  The growth was lifted by increased adoption of the company’s premium RESILIA technologies around the world.\nCritical Care sales were $212 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 7 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2020, or 8 percent on an underlying basis.  Sales growth was driven by contributions from all product lines, led primarily by strong HemoSphere sales in the U.S.\nAdditional Financial Results\nFor the quarter, the adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8 percent, compared to 75.3 percent in the same period last year.  This increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $424 million, or 31.9 percent of sales, compared to $339 million in the prior year.

The Company posted a March quarter record revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.40. International sales accounted for 67 percent of the quarter’s revenue.\n“This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple is in a period of sweeping innovation across our product lineup, and we’re keeping focus on how we can help our teams and the communities where we work emerge from this pandemic into a better world. That certainly begins with products like the all-new iMac and iPad Pro, but it extends to efforts like the 8 gigawatts of new clean energy we’ll help bring onto the grid and our $430 billion investment in the United States over the next 5 years.”\n“We are proud of our March quarter performance, which included revenue records in each of our geographic segments and strong double-digit growth in each of our product categories, driving our installed base of active devices to an all-time high,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results allowed us to generate operating cash flow of $24 billion and return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter. We are confident in our future and continue to make significant investments to support our long-term plans and enrich our customers’ lives.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 7 percent. The dividend is payable on May 13, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2021.

Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 2% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nWe anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $87-89 billion, lowered from our prior range of $88-91 billion. This outlook includes approximately $3.5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.\nWe are also sharing a preliminary outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and our tax rate. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion.

While PPG is disappointed with Lowe’s decision, PPG believes this will create an opportunity to expand the distribution of its products, including\nOlympic\nbrand products, through PPG stores, dealers and other distribution partners.\nOlympic\nhas been America’s most trusted stain brand since 1938 and recently rated among the top stains by a leading independent consumer rankings magazine. PPG remains confident in its long-term strategy to support customers and looks forward to expanding the\nOlympic\nbrand and its strong portfolio of paints and stains to new points of distribution.\nSales at Lowe’s stores in the U.S. represent less than $300 million of PPG’s annual sales. PPG plans to aggressively and appropriately adjust its cost structure to adapt to this change in its business. PPG continues to value its longstanding relationship with Lowe’s and will continue to supply certain specialty building materials to Lowe’s stores.\nPPG’s architectural paints, stains and coatings products are distributed through a diverse network that includes more than 900 company-owned stores, more than 4,000 independent dealers, and approximately 8,000 major retailer locations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this news release relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 reflecting the company’s current view with respect to future events or objectives and financial or operational performance or results.

Markets revenue also increased 10%. In CCB, we opened over 450 thousand net new checking accounts, our 50th consecutive quarter of net new account growth. Client investment assets were up 14% to $1.0 trillion, and we also had a record number of first-time investors. Additionally, Card loans were up 12% on continued robust customer acquisition of 2.4 million. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees were up 13%, and we saw $79 billion of client asset net inflows. Pretax margin remained strong at 32%.”\nDimon continued:\n“While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown. Next, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale.”\nDimon added:\n“We now have a CET1 capital ratio of 15.3%, providing us with excess capital even after the uncertainty created by Basel III endgame. Last month, we announced that the Board intends to increase our common dividend for the second time this year, resulting in a 19% cumulative increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase is supported by our strong financial performance and represents a sustainable level of dividends. Our priorities remain unchanged. We continue to invest heavily into our businesses for long-term growth and profitability. We maintain a fortress balance sheet and prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments.”\nDimon concluded:\n“Finally, we take pride in driving economic growth by extending credit and raising capital totaling more than $1.4 trillion YTD for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers.”\nSIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN CORPORATE IN 2Q24 RESULTS\nn\n$7.9\nbillion net gain related to Visa shares ($2.04 increase in EPS\n10\n)\nn\n$1.0\nbillion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation ($0.18 decrease in EPS)\nn\n$546\nmillion of net investment securities losses ($0.14 decrease in EPS)\nCAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nn\nCommon dividend of $3.3 billion or $1.15 per s...", "gold_standard_guidance": [], "manual_verification_status": "verified", "manual_notes": ""}
