Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services now includes: Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue, already in the PBP\nsegment Enterprise Mobility + Security (“EMS”) and Power BI per-user revenue, previously reported in Azure within the Intelligent Cloud (“IC”) segment Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue, previously\nreported in Windows within the More Personal Computing (“MPC”) segment The cloud portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial will be reported as \"Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud\" and the on-premises portion will be reported as \"Microsoft 365\nCommercial products\" Other segment changes Copilot Pro revenue has moved from Office Consumer products and cloud services in our PBP segment to Search and news advertising in our MPC segment to align to how the business is managed. We then renamed\n“Office Consumer products and cloud services” to “Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services” given the current branding of the product. Nuance Enterprise revenue has moved from Server products and cloud services in\nthe IC segment to Dynamics products and cloud services in the PBP segment. Nuance Healthcare revenue remains in Server products and cloud services. These changes better align to how the businesses are managed. Windows revenue (now excluding Windows\nCommercial revenue as noted above) and Devices revenue will now be reported together in SEC filings to bring revenue from PC market-driven businesses together Revenue moved from Search and news advertising in the MPC segment to Azure in the IC\nsegment, and therefore will be included in Microsoft Cloud metrics, to better align with similar commercial services Updates for FY25 – Segment changes\nMetric changes\nFY25 Investor metrics Commercial\nmetrics Commercial bookings growth Commercial remaining performance obligation Commercial revenue annuity mix Microsoft Cloud revenue and revenue growth Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth Microsoft\n365 Commercial seat growth Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growth Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers Productivity & Business Processes; Intelligent Cloud Dynamics 365 revenue growth LinkedIn revenue growth Azure and other cloud services\nrevenue growth Windows OEM and Devices revenue growth Xbox content and services revenue growth More Personal Computing Search and news advertising revenue (ex TAC) growth\nWhat changes and why? As a result of\nthe Microsoft 365 Commercial segment change, “Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth” metric created in the PBP segment to align to how the business is managed. The metric is comprised of: Office 365 Commercial revenue EMS revenue\nand Power BI per-user revenue, previously in the Azure metric within the IC segment Cloud portion of Windows Commercial revenue, previously in the Windows Commercial metric within the MPC segment With EMS revenue and Power BI per-user revenue moved\ninto Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud metric, Azure metric now more closely aligns to consumption business “Office 365 Commercial seat growth” renamed to “Microsoft 365 Commercial seat growth” to align with product branding\nWhat does not change?

As we\nshared\n, on\nJanuary 19, the security team detected this attack on our corporate email systems and immediately activated our response process. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence investigation identified the threat actor as\nMidnight Blizzard\n, the\nRussian state-sponsored actor also known as NOBELIUM.\nAs we said at that time, our investigation was ongoing, and we would provide additional details as\nappropriate.\nIn recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to\ngain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access. This has included access to some of the company’s source code repositories and internal systems. To date we have found no evidence that Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems have been\ncompromised.\nIt is apparent that Midnight Blizzard is attempting to use secrets of different types it has found. Some of these secrets were shared\nbetween customers and Microsoft in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures. Midnight Blizzard has increased the volume of some aspects\nof the attack, such as password sprays, by as much as\n10-fold\nin February, compared to the already large volume we saw in January 2024.\nMidnight Blizzard’s ongoing attack is characterized by a sustained, significant commitment of the threat actor’s resources, coordination, and focus.\nIt may be using the information it has obtained to accumulate a picture of areas to attack and enhance its ability to do so. This reflects what has become more broadly an unprecedented global threat landscape, especially in terms of sophisticated\nnation-state attacks.\nAcross Microsoft, we have increased our security investments, cross-enterprise coordination and mobilization, and have enhanced our\nability to defend ourselves and secure and harden our environment against this advanced persistent threat. We have and will continue to put in place additional enhanced security controls, detections, and monitoring.\nOur active investigations of Midnight Blizzard activities are ongoing, and findings of our investigations will continue to evolve. We remain committed to\nsharing what we learn.", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "21f3c914ce2cd50b2a583521188cceb3d6bd245eab682422ecbaefcd242b47c2"}

Microsoft has identified the threat actor as\nMidnight Blizzard\n, the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as Nobelium. As part\nof our ongoing commitment to responsible transparency as recently affirmed in our\nSecure Future Initiative\n(SFI), we are sharing this update.\nBeginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy\nnon-production\ntest tenant account and gain a foothold, and then used the account’s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal,\nand other functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself. We are in the process of notifying employees whose\nemail was accessed.\nThe attack was not the result of a vulnerability in Microsoft products or services. To date, there is no evidence that the threat\nactor had any access to customer environments, production systems, source code, or AI systems. We will notify customers if any action is required.\nThis\nattack does highlight the continued risk posed to all organizations from well-resourced nation-state threat actors like\nMidnight Blizzard\n.\nAs we\nsaid late last year when we announced\nSecure Future Initiative\n(SFI), given the reality of threat actors that are resourced and funded by nation states, we are shifting the balance we need to strike between security and business risk –\nthe traditional sort of calculus is simply no longer sufficient. For Microsoft, this incident has highlighted the urgent need to move even faster. We will act immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned legacy systems and\ninternal business processes, even when these changes might cause disruption to existing business processes.\nThis will likely cause some level of\ndisruption while we adapt to this new reality, but this is a necessary step, and only the first of several we will be taking to embrace this philosophy.\nWe are continuing our investigation and will take additional actions based on the outcomes of this investigation and will continue working with law\nenforcement and appropriate regulators. We are deeply committed to sharing more information and our learnings, so that the community can benefit from both our experience and observations about the threat actor. We will provide additional details as\nappropriate.", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "e80a187070b404661a27af1e6ad7e1ac45e24d691c532da65283f58e1431558b"}

We have changed our corporate structure and practices since the years covered by the audit, and as a result, the issues raised by the IRS are relevant to the\npast but not to our current practices.\nThe IRS recently sent us a series of Notices of Proposed Adjustment (NOPAs), sharing with us\nfor the first time detailed information and explanations of their views about the issues in question. This marks the end of the audit covering 2004 to 2013, and the beginning of a new process to resolve these\ndecades-old\nissues.\nThe IRS says Microsoft owes an additional $28.9 billion in tax for\n2004 to 2013, plus penalties and interest. The IRS’s proposed adjustments do not represent a final determination. Not reflected in the proposed adjustments are taxes paid by Microsoft under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which could decrease\nthe final tax owed under the audit by up to $10 billion.\nMicrosoft disagrees with these proposed adjustments and will pursue an\nappeal within the IRS, a process expected to take several years. We believe we have always followed the IRS’s rules and paid the taxes we owe in the U.S. and around the world. Microsoft historically has been one of the top U.S. corporate income\ntaxpayers. Since 2004, we have paid over $67 billion in taxes to the U.S.\nWhat the dispute is about\nThe main disagreement is the way Microsoft allocated profits during this time period among countries and jurisdictions. This is commonly referred\nto as transfer pricing and the IRS has established regulations that allow companies to use a specific arrangement for transfer pricing, called cost-sharing.\nMany large multinationals use cost-sharing because it reflects the global nature of their business. Because our subsidiaries shared in the costs\nof developing certain intellectual property, under those IRS cost-sharing regulations, the subsidiaries were also entitled to the related profits.\nNext steps: Proposed adjustments and IRS Appeals\nWe strongly believe we have acted in accordance with IRS\nrules and regulations and that our position is supported by case law. We welcome the IRS’s conclusion of its audit phase which will provide us with the opportunity to work through these issues at IRS Appeals, a separate division of the IRS\ncharged with resolving tax disputes.\nIt is important to note that the IRS Appeals process will take several years to complete, and if\nwe are unable to come to a direct agreement with the IRS, Microsoft will then have an opportunity to contest any unresolved issues through the courts.\nWe will continue to work with the IRS and hope to reach a mutual resolution to this issue over the coming years. We will also continue to share updates on significant developments through our public quarterly and annual reports and\nfinancial statements, as we have through this entire process. As of September 30, 2023, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate.", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "fbc3a3c0b3c7c7f1fab60da1333d228911b3d32ce5363ad26abb5402a5192be5"}

Intelligent Cloud revenue increased driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased driven by Office 365 Commercial. More Personal Computing revenue decreased driven by Devices and Windows, offset in part by Search and news advertising.\nCost of revenue increased $366 million or 2% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud, offset in part by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in accounting estimate for the useful lives of our server and network equipment and a decline in Devices.\nGross margin increased $4.0 billion or 11% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes and the change in accounting estimate.\n•\nGross margin percentage increased. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvements in Productivity and Business Processes and sales mix shift, offset in part by declines in Intelligent Cloud.\n•\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased 3 points to 72%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365 Commercial, offset in part by lower Azure and other cloud services margin.\nOperating expenses increased $238 million or 2% driven by a charge related to a non-public preliminary draft decision provided by the Irish Data Protection Commission (the “IDPC matter”).\nOperating income increased $3.7 billion or 18% driven by growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and the change in accounting estimate.\nRevenue, gross margin, and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nProductivity and Business Processes\nRevenue increased $1.7 billion or 10%.\n•\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased $1.2 billion or 12%. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 15% with seat growth of 11%, driven by small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, as well as growth in revenue per user. Office Commercial products revenue declined 20% driven by continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n•\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased $54 million or 3%. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew 12% to 67.0 million.\n•\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased $236 million or 19% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 26%.\n•\nLinkedIn revenue increased $197 million or 5% driven by growth in Talent Solutions, offset in part by a decline in Marketing Solutions.\nOperating income increased $1.8 billion or 25%.\n•\nGross margin increased $1.8 billion or 14% driven by growth in Office 365 Commercial. Gross margin percentage increased. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased 1 point driven by improvement in Office 365 Commercial.\n•\nOperating expenses decreased slightly primarily driven by declines in LinkedIn and Office marketing, offset in part by a charge related to the IDPC matter.\nRevenue, gross margin, and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively.\nIntelligent Cloud\nRevenue increased $3.2 billion or 15%.\n•\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased $3.1 billion or 17% driven by Azure and other cloud services. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 26% driven by growth in our consumption-based services. Server products revenue decreased 1%.\n•\nEnterprise Services revenue increased $75 million or 4% driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services, offset in part by a decline in Industry Solutions (formerly Microsoft Consulting Services).\nOperating income increased $1.7 billion or 20%.\n•\nGross margin increased $2.3 billion or 16% driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services and the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased 2 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and other cloud services and lower Azure and other cloud services margin.\n•\nOperating expenses increased $570 million or 10% primarily driven by a charge related to the IDPC matter.\nRevenue and operating income both included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.\nMore Personal Computing\nRevenue decreased $556 million or 4%.\n•\nWindows revenue decreased $337 million or 5% driven by a decrease in Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue decreased 12% primarily driven by continued PC market weakness, offset in part by roughly 7 points of benefit from early back-to-school inventory builds. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 2% driven by demand for Microsoft 365.\n•\nDevices revenue decreased $339 million or 20%.\n•\nSearch and news advertising revenue increased $86 million or 3%. Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 8% driven by higher search volume, as the benefit from the Xandr acquisition was more than offset by the impact from third-party partnerships.\n•\nGaming revenue increased $36 million or 1% driven by growth in Xbox content and services, offset in part by a decline in Xbox hardware. Xbox content and services revenue increased 5% driven by growth in third-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 13% driven by lower volume of consoles sold.\nOperating income increased $186 million or 4%.\n•\nGross margin decreased $124 million or 2% driven by a decline in Windows, offset in part by growth in Gaming. Gross margin percentage increased driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses.\n•\nOperating expenses decreased $310 million or 9% driven by declines in Devices and Windows, offset in part by a charge related to the IDPC matter.\nGross margin and operating income both included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n•\nResearch and development expenses decreased $110 million or 2% driven by a decline in Devices, offset in part by investments in LinkedIn.\n•\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $100 million or 2% primarily driven by declines in Windows, LinkedIn, and Devices advertising.\n•\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $448 million or 26% driven by a charge related to the IDPC matter.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nOther income (expense), net was $473 million driven by interest and dividends income, offset in part by interest expense.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe current quarter effective tax rate was 19% compared to 18% in the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nREMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $229 billion as of June 30, 2023, of which $224 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue.

First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more\nwith less. We’re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one. At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born\nwith advances in AI, as we’re turning the world’s most advanced models into a new computing platform.\nThis is the context in which we as a company must\nstrive to deliver results on an ongoing basis, while investing in our long-term opportunity. I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive, but it requires us to take actions grounded in three priorities.\nFirst, we will align our cost structure with our revenue and where we see customer demand. Today, we are making changes that will result in the reduction of our overall\nworkforce by 10,000 jobs through the end of FY23 Q3. This represents less than 5 percent of our total employee base, with some notifications happening today. It’s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will\ncontinue to hire in key strategic areas. We know this is a challenging time for each person impacted. The senior leadership team and I are committed that as we go through this process, we will do so in the most thoughtful and transparent way\npossible.\nSecond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas for our future, meaning we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth\nand long-term competitiveness for the company, while divesting in other areas. These are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our\n47-year\nhistory to remain a consequential company in this industry\nthat is unforgiving to anyone who doesn’t adapt to platform shifts. As such, we are taking a $1.2B charge in Q2 related to severance costs, changes to our hardware portfolio, and the cost of lease consolidation as we create higher density\nacross our workspaces.\nAnd third, we will treat our people with dignity and respect, and act transparently. These decisions are difficult, but necessary. They are\nespecially difficult because they impact people and people’s lives—our colleagues and friends. We are committed to ensuring all those whose roles are eliminated have our full support during these transitions. U.S.-benefit-eligible\nemployees will receive a variety of benefits, including above-market severance pay, continuing healthcare coverage for six months, continued vesting of stock awards for six months, career transition services, and 60 days’ notice prior to\ntermination, regardless of whether such notice is legally required. Benefits for employees outside the U.S. will align with the employment laws in each country.\nWhen I think about this moment in time, the start of 2023, it’s showtime—for our industry and for Microsoft. As a company, our success must be aligned to the\nworld’s success. That means every one of us and every team across the company must raise the bar and perform better than the competition to deliver meaningful innovation that customers, communities, and countries can truly benefit from. If we\ndeliver on this, we will emerge stronger and thrive long into the future; it’s as simple as that.\nI want to extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone\nwho has contributed to Microsoft up to this point and to all of you who will continue to contribute as we chart our path ahead. Thank you for the focus, dedication, and resilience you demonstrate for Microsoft and our customers and partners each\nday.\nSatya", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "e945afc3ed03acc06c94936eda9e4ff286bcbde3a249440c6d9f2c67c7234215"}

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Microsoft transferred certain intangible properties from our\nPuerto Rico subsidiary to the United States. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as the value of future United States tax deductions exceeds the current tax\nliability from the United States Global Intangible\nLow-Taxed\nIncome tax.\nMicrosoft has\nprovided\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures assist investors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be\nconsidered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant\nCurrency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses\nperformed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States\ndollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has\nprovided this\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should\nnot be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating\nIncome\nNet Income\nDiluted\nEarnings per\nShare\n2021 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$45,317\n$20,238\n$20,505\n$2.71\n2021 As\nAdjusted\n$45,317\n$20,238\n$17,214\n$2.27\n2022 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$50,122\n$21,518\n$17,556\n$2.35\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\n11%\n6%\n(14)%\n(13)%\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (As Adjusted)\n11%\n6%\n2%\n4%\nConstant\nCurrency Impact\n$(2,296)\n$(1,662)\n$(1,363)\n$(0.18)\nPercentage Change\nY/Y Constant Currency\n16%\n15%\n(8)%\n(7)%\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (As Adjusted) Constant Currency\n16%\n15%\n10%\n11%\nSegment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in millions)\nProductivity and\nBusiness Processes\nIntelligent Cloud\nMore Personal\nComputing\n2021 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$15,039\n$16,912\n$13,366\n2022 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$16,465\n$20,325\n$13,332\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\n9%\n20%\n0%\nConstant\nCurrency Impact\n$(856)\n$(996)\n$(444)\nPercentage Change\nY/Y Constant Currency\n15%\n26%\n3%\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business.\nSelected Product and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2022\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\nConstant Currency\nImpact\nPercentage Change\nY/Y Constant\nCurrency\nMicrosoft\nCloud revenue\n24%\n7%\n31%\nOffice\nCommercial products and cloud services\n7%\n6%\n13%\nOffice 365\nCommercial\n11%\n6%\n17%\nOffice\nConsumer products and cloud services\n7%\n4%\n11%\nLinkedIn\n17%\n4%\n21%\nDynamics\nproducts and cloud services\n15%\n7%\n22%\nDynamics\n365\n24%\n8%\n32%\nServer\nproducts and cloud services\n22%\n6%\n28%\nAzure and\nother cloud services\n35%\n7%\n42%\nWindows\nOEM\n(15)%\n0%\n(15)%\nWindows\nCommercial products and cloud services\n8%\n7%\n15%\nXbox content\nand services\n(3)%\n4%\n1%\nSearch and\nnews advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs\n16%\n5%\n21%\nDevices\n2%\n6%\n8%\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

The webcast will be available for replay through the close of\nbusiness on July 26, 2023.\nNon-GAAP\nDefinition\nTransfer of Intangible Properties\n. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Microsoft transferred certain intangible properties from our\nPuerto Rico subsidiary to the United States. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as the value of future United States tax deductions exceeds the current tax\nliability from the United States Global Intangible\nLow-Taxed\nIncome tax.\nThe India Supreme\nCourt Decision Impact\n. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court issued a decision on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax. Microsoft has historically paid\nIndia withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not\nsubject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft’s software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft recorded a net income tax benefit of\n$620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties and\nthe India Supreme Court decision to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures assist investors by providing additional insight into its operational\nperformance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance.\nThe\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect\nof foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average\nexchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods.

Microsoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India\nSupreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft’s software sales\nin India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision\nimpacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial\nmeasures related to the India Supreme Court decision to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures assist investors by providing additional insight into\nits operational performance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating\nbusiness performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and\ncomparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in\neffect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial information to aid investors in better\nunderstanding our performance.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, Microsoft transferred certain intangible properties from our\nPuerto Rico subsidiary to the United States. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as the value of future United States tax deductions exceeds the current tax\nliability from the United States Global Intangible\nLow-Taxed\nIncome tax.\nMicrosoft has\nprovided\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures assist investors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be\nconsidered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant\nCurrency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses\nperformed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States\ndollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has\nprovided this\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should\nnot be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating\nIncome\nNet Income\nDiluted\nEarnings per\nShare\n2020 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$37,154\n$15,876\n$13,893\n$1.82\n2021 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$45,317\n$20,238\n$20,505\n$2.71\n2021 As\nAdjusted\n(non-GAAP)\n$45,317\n$20,238\n$17,214\n$2.27\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\n22%\n27%\n48%\n49%\nPercentage Change\nY/Y\n(non-GAAP)\n22%\n27%\n24%\n25%\nConstant\nCurrency Impact\n$605\n$500\n$248\n$0.03\nPercentage Change\nY/Y\n(non-GAAP)\nConstant Currency\n20%\n24%\n22%\n23%\nSegment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in millions)\nProductivity and\nBusiness Processes\nIntelligent Cloud\nMore Personal\nComputing\n2020 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$12,319\n$12,986\n$11,849\n2021 As\nReported (GAAP)\n$15,039\n$16,964\n$13,314\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\n22%\n31%\n12%\nConstant\nCurrency Impact\n$253\n$216\n$136\nPercentage Change\nY/Y\n(non-GAAP)\nConstant Currency\n20%\n29%\n11%\nSelected Product and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2021\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (GAAP)\nConstant Currency\nImpact\nPercentage Change\nY/Y (non-GAAP)\nConstant\nCurrency\nOffice\nCommercial products and cloud services\n18%\n(2)%\n16%\nOffice 365\nCommercial\n23%\n(2)%\n21%\nOffice\nConsumer products and cloud services\n10%\n(2)%\n8%\nLinkedIn\n42%\n(3)%\n39%\nLinkedIn\nMarketing Solutions\n61%\n(2)%\n59%\nDynamics\nproducts and cloud services\n31%\n(2)%\n29%\nDynamics\n365\n48%\n(3)%\n45%\nServer\nproducts and cloud services\n35%\n(2)%\n33%\nAzure and\nother cloud services\n50%\n(2)%\n48%\nWindows\nOEM\n10%\n0%\n10%\nWindows\nCommercial products and cloud services\n12%\n(2)%\n10%\nXbox content\nand services\n2%\n(2)%\n0%\nSearch and\nnews advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs\n40%\n(1)%\n39%\nSurface\n(17)%\n(2)%\n(19)%\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

Microsoft has historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. The India\nSupreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although Microsoft was not a party to the appeals, Microsoft’s software sales\nin India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, Microsoft recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision\nimpacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\nMicrosoft has provided\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial\nmeasures related to the India Supreme Court decision to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures assist investors by providing additional insight into\nits operational performance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers\nnon-GAAP\nmeasures in conjunction with generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) financial results in evaluating business performance. The\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2021, reported in accordance with GAAP to\nnon-GAAP\nfinancial results.

And this week, we released our first set of features for Apple Intelligence, which sets a new standard for privacy in AI and supercharges our lineup heading into the holiday season.”\n“Our record business performance during the September quarter drove nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to return over $29 billion to our shareholders,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We are very pleased that our active installed base of devices reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of the Company’s common stock.

The Company believes that the presentation of results excluding the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s core operating results and facilitates comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP results.\n(b)\nNon-GAAP adjustments to provision for income taxes and net income to reflect the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the European General Court and confirmed the European Commission’s 2016 State Aid decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of restricted funds held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.

Cook, et\nal.\n, Case No. 4:19-cv-05153, (the “\nZehrer\nAction”) against defendants Cook, Maestri, Federighi, Levinson, Gore, Jung, Bell, Sugar, Iger, and Wagner alleging, among other things, that\nDefendants breached their fiduciary duties (i) by causing or allowing the Company to address the effects of aging iPhone batteries by disseminating iOS software updates designed to slow iPhone performance without customer knowledge or\nconsent in violation of consumer protection laws and regulations in domestic and international markets, and (ii) by making false and misleading statements to investors about the effects of aging iPhone batteries on iPhone sales growth and\nabout iPhone demand in the Greater China region.\nOn March 11, 2020, the Federal Court entered an order consolidating the\nZehrer\nAction with three other, subsequently-filed\nactions that asserted similar claims (hereafter, the “Federal Action”). On June 29, 2020, the Federal Court appointed Robbins LLP and Weiss Law LLP as Co-Lead Counsel for the Federal Plaintiffs in the Federal Action.\nOn August 18, 2020, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to stay the Federal Action pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the related federal securities\nclass action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division,\nIn re Apple Inc. Securities Litigation\n, Case No. 4:19-cv-02033-YGR (the “Federal\nSecurities Action”), subject to Federal Plaintiffs’ rights to file a consolidated complaint and to seek to inspect the Company’s books and records pursuant to California Corporations Code section 1601, and to the parties’ obligation to\nmeet and confer regarding Federal Plaintiffs’ participation in any mediation and any discovery conducted in connection with the Federal Securities Action.\n- 3 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nOn January 25, 2021, following the partial denial of the motion to dismiss the related Federal Securities Action, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to continue\nthe stay of the Federal Action until 30 days following the close of fact discovery in the Federal Securities Action, subject to the Company’s commitment to participate in a mediation of the derivative claims in the event of any mediation in\nthe Federal Securities Action or other action arising from the same or similar facts; designation of the board of directors as constituted on August 19, 2019, as the relevant set of directors for purposes of evaluating Federal Plaintiffs’\ndemand futility allegations; and preservation of Federal Plaintiffs’ right to file a consolidated amended complaint.\nOn June 7, August 17, and October 14, 2022, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulations to continue the stay, subject to substantially similar terms and\nconditions.\nOn March 27, 2023, the Court granted the Federal Action parties’ stipulation to set a briefing schedule for Apple’s motion to dismiss the action under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23.1.\nOn May 24, 2023, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation extending Federal Plaintiffs’ time to complete their ongoing investigation of matters relevant to their\nallegations and to file their consolidated complaint.\nOn October 5, 2023, the parties to the Federal Action filed a stipulation advising the Court that they had executed a memorandum of understanding to settle the Action,\nand commenced negotiations regarding a formal stipulation of settlement to be presented for the Court’s approval.\nCALIFORNIA COURT PROCEEDINGS\nOn September 17, 2019, plaintiff Tim Himstreet filed a derivative action in California Court captioned as\nHimstreet v. Cook, et al.\n,\nCase No. 19CV355213 (the “\nHimstreet\nAction”) asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action. On August 17, 2020, plaintiff Steven Hill filed a derivative action in California Court\ncaptioned as\nHill v. Cook, et al.\n, 20CV369387 (the “\nHill\nAction”), asserting similar claims. On November 16, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating\nthe\nHimstreet\nAction and\nHill\nAction (hereafter, the “California Action”). Pursuant to the parties’ stipulations, the California Court stayed the\nCalifornia Action on terms similar to those in the Federal Action, extending that stay in orders entered on July 1, 2022, October 6, 2022, and March 24, 2023.\n- 4 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nSHAREHOLDER LITIGATION DEMAND\nOn November 13, 2018, the Demanding Shareholders made a litigation demand on Apple’s board of directors asserting claims similar to those raised in the Federal Action\n(the “Demand”).\nOn December 9, 2018, Apple’s board formed an advisory Demand Evaluation Committee (“DEC”) to review and investigate the Demand, with the advice of independent\ncounsel, and report back to the full board concerning its conclusions and recommendations.\nTHE PARTIES REACHED THE SETTLEMENT THROUGH MEDIATOR FACILITATED ARM’S-LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS\nOn January 31, 2022, counsel for the Parties participated in a mediation session before Layn Phillips of Phillips ADR (the “Mediator”), a nationally recognized\nmediator with extensive experience mediating complex shareholder disputes similar to the Actions.\nPrior to this first mediation, the plaintiffs in the Federal Action and California Action submitted a mediation statement, made a settlement demand on Defendants, and\nrequested certain documents, which Defendants agreed to provide.\nThe Parties did not reach an agreement resolving the derivative litigation during the January 31, 2022 mediation session, but agreed to continue their settlement\ndiscussions under the aegis of the Mediator.\nCounsel for the Parties participated in another mediation session before the Mediator on April 6, 2023. At the mediation session, the Parties engaged in discussions\nregarding the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and defenses at issue. The parties also discussed a range of remedial options and were able to agree on a set of principles and target areas for corporate governance enhancements to be\nfleshed out through further negotiations. The mediation efforts actively continued telephonically for several months following the April mediation session, during which the Parties exchanged written proposals and counter proposals with\nthe assistance and guidance of the Mediator.\n- 5 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nThe Parties ultimately reached an agreement to settle and release all claims asserted in consideration for Apple’s agreement to adopt, implement, and/or maintain\nthe corporate governance and oversight enhancements as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the “Enhancements”).\nAfter reaching agreement on the substantive material terms of the Settlement, the Parties commenced negotiations facilitated by the Mediator regarding reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel, subject to Court approval, in consideration for the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders by the Settlement.\nThe Stipulation, together with the exhibits hereto, which has been duly executed by the undersigned signatories on behalf of their respective clients, reflects the\nfinal and binding agreement by and among the Parties.\nOn April 23, 2024, the Federal Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to Apple shareholders, and scheduled the\nSettlement Fairness Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement.\nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT?\nThe full terms and conditions of the Settlement are embodied in the Stipulation, which is on file with the Federal Court. The following is only a summary of the\nStipulation.\nIn consideration of the full settlement and release of the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims (defined below) against the Released Defendants’ Parties (defined below) and\nthe dismissal with prejudice of the Actions, Defendants and Apple have agreed that Apple shall adopt and implement the corporate governance enhancements identified in Exhibit A to the Stipulation in the time and manner specified\ntherein.\nThe Board, on behalf of the Company, and in a determination made in the good faith exercise of the Board’s business judgment, acknowledges and agrees that the\nfiling of, pendency of, and/or settlement demands made in the Actions caused Apple to adopt, implement, and/or maintain the Enhancements.

Based on Plaintiffs’ oversight of the prosecution of this matter and with the advice of their counsel, Plaintiffs have agreed to settle and release the claims asserted in the Actions pursuant to the terms and\nprovisions of the Stipulation, after considering (a) the substantial benefits conferred upon Apple and its shareholders through the corporate governance protections provided under the proposed Settlement; and (b) the desirability\nof guaranteeing those benefits by permitting the proposed Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation, and avoiding the uncertainties, delays, costs, and substantial risks entailed in further\nlitigation.\nDefendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they committed, or aided and abetted in the commission of, any violation of law or duty or engaged in any\nwrongful acts whatsoever, including specifically those alleged in the Actions, and expressly maintain that they have complied with their statutory, fiduciary, and other legal duties, and that at all relevant times they acted in\ngood faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Defendants, however, have also taken into account the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further\nlitigation, and have therefore determined that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Actions to be settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation.\n- 10 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nEach of the Parties recognizes and acknowledges that the Actions have been initiated, filed, and prosecuted by Plaintiffs in good faith and defended by\nDefendants in good faith, that the Actions are being voluntarily settled with the advice of counsel, and that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate.\nIn addition, Apple’s Board, including each of its independent, non-employee directors (including the members of the DEC), advised by outside counsel for the\nCompany, has unanimously approved a resolution reflecting the Board’s determination, in the good faith exercise of its business judgment, that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders, and that\nthe Settlement and each of its terms are fair and reasonable and serve the best interests of Apple and its shareholders.\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED? WHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE?\nIf the Settlement is approved, the Parties will request that the Federal Court enter a Final Judgment and Order Approving Derivative Action Settlement (the\n“Judgment”). Pursuant to the Judgment, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, the following releases will occur:\nRelease of Claims by Plaintiffs, the Company, and the Company’s Shareholders:\nPlaintiffs, the Company, and by\noperation of law the Company’s shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from\ncommencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Litigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Defendants’ Parties.\n“Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims” means any and all manner of Claims, including Unknown Claims, that have been or could have been asserted in any forum\nderivatively or by Apple directly, arising from any act or omission alleged or claims asserted in the Actions;\nprovided, however\n, that the Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims shall not include\nany Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement.

With respect to any and all Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims and Settled Defendants’ Claims, the Parties stipulate\nand agree that, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, Defendants, the Company, and Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Judgment shall have, expressly waived any and all\nprovisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law or foreign law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to California Civil Code §1542, which\nprovides:\nA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of\nexecuting the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\nAny of Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, or Current Apple Shareholders may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those which he, she, or\nit now knows or believes to be true with respect to the Settled Claims but, upon the Court’s entry of the Judgment, Plaintiffs, Defendants, Apple, and each of the Current Apple Shareholders shall be deemed to have, and by\noperation of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled any and all Settled Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or additional facts. Plaintiffs, Defendants, and\nthe Company acknowledge that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and a key element of the Settlement.\n“Released Defendants’ Parties” means Defendants, the Company, and any entity in which the Company has a controlling interest, as well as their respective\ncurrent and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees, immediate family\nmembers, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys.\nRelease of Claims by Defendants and the Company:\nDefendants and the Company shall be deemed to have, and by\noperation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever discharged, settled, and released, and shall forever be enjoined from commencing or prosecuting, any and all Settled Defendants’ Claims and Settled\nLitigation Claims (including Unknown Claims) against the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties.\n“Settled Defendants’ Claims” means all Claims that arise out of or are based upon the commencement, litigation, or settlement of the Actions;\nprovided, however\n, that the Settled Defendants’ Claims shall not include any Claims arising out of, based upon, or relating to the enforcement of the Settlement.\n“Released Plaintiffs’ Parties” means Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and any entity in which any Plaintiff has a controlling interest, as well as their\nrespective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, committees, joint ventures, trustees, trusts, employees,\nimmediate family members, insurers and reinsurers (in their capacities as such), consultants, experts, and attorneys.\n- 12 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nWithin ten (10) calendar days of the Federal Court’s entry of the Judgment, the parties to the California Action will file a stipulation with the\nCalifornia Court dismissing the California Action with prejudice, and the Demanding Shareholders shall withdraw the Demand with prejudice.\nThe “Effective Date” of the Settlement will be the first date upon which the following conditions of the Settlement have been met and occurred: (i) the\nCourt has approved the Settlement as described herein, following notice to Current Apple Shareholders and a hearing, and entered the Judgment, and the Judgment has become Final; (ii) the California Action has been dismissed\nwith prejudice; and (iii) the Demand has been withdrawn with prejudice.\nBy Order of the Federal Court, all proceedings in the Federal Action, other than proceedings necessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions\nof the Stipulation, have been stayed until otherwise ordered by the Federal Court. Also, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the Federal Court has (i) barred and enjoined the\ncommencement or prosecution of any action asserting any Settled Plaintiffs’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Defendants’ Parties; and (b) barred and enjoined the commencement or prosecution of\nany action asserting any Settled Defendants’ Claims or Settled Litigation Claims against any of the Released Plaintiffs’ Parties.\nHOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID?\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel have not received any payment for their services in pursuing the claims asserted in the Actions, nor have Plaintiffs’ Counsel been\nreimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. Plaintiffs’ Counsel invested their own resources for pursuing the claims asserted on a contingency basis; meaning they would only recover their expenses and be compensated for\ntheir time if they conferred substantial benefits upon Apple and its shareholders through this Action. In light of the risks undertaken in pursuing the Actions on a contingency basis and the substantial benefits created\nfor Apple and its shareholders through the Settlement, the Parties agree that, subject to Court approval, Apple shall pay or cause to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses to Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the agreed amount of\n$6,000,000 (the “Fee and Expense Amount”).\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel will apply to the Court for service awards of $5,000 (“Service Awards”) to each of the Plaintiffs to be drawn from the Fee and\nExpense Amount.\n- 13 -\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS\nThe Federal Court will determine whether to approve the Fee and Expense Amount and/or Service Awards.

The Company posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.18, up 16 percent year over year.\n“Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments. And as customers begin to experience the incredible Apple Vision Pro tomorrow, we are committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation — in line with our values and on behalf of our customers.”\n“Our December quarter top-line performance combined with margin expansion drove an all-time record EPS of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “During the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders. We are confident in our future, and continue to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of the Company’s common stock.

The Company posted quarterly revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52, unchanged year over year.\n“We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We continue to invest for the long term and lead with our values, including making major progress toward building carbon neutral products and supply chains by 2030.”\n“Our year-over-year business performance improved compared to the December quarter, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion while returning over $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given our confidence in Apple’s future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We are also raising our quarterly dividend for the eleventh year in a row.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 4 percent. The dividend is payable on May 18, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2023. The board of directors has also authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on May 4, 2023 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

The Company posted a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52.\n“This quarter’s record results are a testament to Apple’s relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are delighted to see the strong customer response to our new products, as well as the progress we’re making to become carbon neutral across our supply chain and our products by 2030. We are committed, as ever, to being a force for good in the world — both in what we create and what we leave behind.”\n“We are very pleased with our record business results for the March quarter, as we set an all-time revenue record for Services and March quarter revenue records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Continued strong customer demand for our products helped us achieve an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Our strong operating performance generated over $28 billion in operating cash flow, and allowed us to return nearly $27 billion to our shareholders during the quarter.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 5 percent. The dividend is payable on May 12, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2022. The board of directors has also authorized an increase of $90 billion to the existing share repurchase program.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2022 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on April 28, 2022 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

The Company posted an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, up 11 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10.\n“This quarter’s record results were made possible by our most innovative lineup of products and services ever,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are gratified to see the response from customers around the world at a time when staying connected has never been more important. We are doing all we can to help build a better world — making progress toward our goal of becoming carbon neutral across our supply chain and products by 2030, and pushing forward with our work in education and racial equity and justice.”\n“The very strong customer response to our recent launch of new products and services drove double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, and helped set an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These record operating results allowed us to return nearly $27 billion to our shareholders during the quarter, as we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2022.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2022 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on January 27, 2022 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

The Company posted a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, up 29 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.24.\n“This year we launched our most powerful products ever, from M1-powered Macs to an iPhone 13 lineup that is setting a new standard for performance and empowering our customers to create and connect in new ways,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are infusing our values into everything we make — moving closer to our 2030 goal of being carbon neutral up and down our supply chain and across the lifecycle of our products, and ever advancing our mission to build a more equitable future.”\n“Our record September quarter results capped off a remarkable fiscal year of strong double-digit growth, during which we set new revenue records in all of our geographic segments and product categories in spite of continued uncertainty in the macro environment,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “The combination of our record sales performance, unmatched customer loyalty, and strength of our ecosystem drove our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. During the September quarter, we returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to make progress toward our goal of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 8, 2021.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2021 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on October 28, 2021 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

The Company posted a March quarter record revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.40. International sales accounted for 67 percent of the quarter’s revenue.\n“This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple is in a period of sweeping innovation across our product lineup, and we’re keeping focus on how we can help our teams and the communities where we work emerge from this pandemic into a better world. That certainly begins with products like the all-new iMac and iPad Pro, but it extends to efforts like the 8 gigawatts of new clean energy we’ll help bring onto the grid and our $430 billion investment in the United States over the next 5 years.”\n“We are proud of our March quarter performance, which included revenue records in each of our geographic segments and strong double-digit growth in each of our product categories, driving our installed base of active devices to an all-time high,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results allowed us to generate operating cash flow of $24 billion and return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter. We are confident in our future and continue to make significant investments to support our long-term plans and enrich our customers’ lives.”\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 7 percent. The dividend is payable on May 13, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2021. The board of directors has also authorized an increase of $90 billion to the existing share repurchase program.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2021 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on April 28, 2021 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

More information on these risks and other potential factors that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including in the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.

The Company posted all-time record revenue of $111.4 billion, up 21 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 35 percent. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue.\n“This quarter for Apple wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re gratified by the enthusiastic customer response to the unmatched line of cutting-edge products that we delivered across a historic holiday season. We are also focused on how we can help the communities we’re a part of build back strongly and equitably, through efforts like our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative as well as our multi-year commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the United States.”\n“Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results helped us generate record operating cash flow of $38.8 billion. We also returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the quarter as we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.”\nApple’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021.\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2021 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on January 27, 2021 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

Profitability $1.6B GAAP operating income $1.4B GAAP net income $1.8B non-GAAP net income1 In Q3, the Tesla team achieved record vehicle deliveries globally, showing strength and growth  across all regions, while also achieving record energy storage deployments across the  residential, industrial and utility sectors. This strong performance resulted in both record  revenue and free cash flow generation in the quarter. We continue to launch new products that excite our customers across automotive and energy.  We launched the Model YL and Model Y Performance and further expanded our vehicle offering  with the Model 3 and Model Y Standard, our most affordable vehicles. We also unveiled the  Megapack 3 and Megablock, which will further simplify large battery installations by reducing  cost and time to deploy. We believe our scale and cost structure will enable us to navigate the  shifting market dynamics across the globe more effectively than our peers, with advances in AI  making our products the most compelling in the market. Our focus remains on scaling our core hardware business by maximizing our deliveries and  deployments, as these products will deliver increasing value to our customers over time via  services powered by AI. Every Tesla vehicle delivered today is designed for autonomy while  every Tesla energy storage product is capable of being enhanced and optimized by our virtual  power plant or Autobidder functionality. We continue to deliver a fleet of products that brings  AI into the real world as we pursue a future of sustainable abundance as outlined in our Master  Plan Part IV. While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused  on long-term growth and value creation. We are prudently making the necessary investments in  our business, including future business lines, that we believe will drive incredible value for Tesla  and the world across transport, energy and robotics.

US: California, Nevada and Texas In October, we launched the Model 3 and Model Y Standard, each with over 300 miles of range  and starting at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively, making our products more accessible to  customers in the wake of the expiration of the EV tax credit in the U.S. Even with their  affordable starting price, these models come standard with what makes Tesla so appealing,  including active safety features, a 15.4” center touchscreen and heated first-row seats and  steering wheel. We also launched the Model Y Performance (0-60 in 3.3 seconds) and began  offering leasing for certified pre-owned Model 3s and Model Ys. APAC: Shanghai We launched the Model YL in China, a longer wheelbase version of the Model Y with 6 seats and  3 rows, expanding our product portfolio in this critical market. We achieved record deliveries in  South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore and began deliveries of the Model Y in India. South  Korea is now our third largest market behind only the U.S. and China, serving as validation of  our competitive positioning in a robust EV market. We launched FSD (Supervised)1 in Australia  and New Zealand and continue to prepare for a broader launch in China, pending regulatory  approval. Europe and the Middle East: Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y is the best-selling vehicle in Norway, Switzerland and Iceland YTD, in Finland for Q3 and  in the Netherlands and Denmark in September. At Gigafactory Berlin, we produced the  100,000th refreshed Model Y and started production of the Model Y Performance. We continue  to pursue the launch of FSD (Supervised)1 in Europe, pending regulatory approval.7 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China\nTesla AI training capacity ramp through end of September (H100 equivalent GPUs) C O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised)1 (billions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware We began deploying v14 of FSD (Supervised)(1) in October, bringing a large portion of the Robotaxi  FSD model to consumers plus improved handling of several complex scenarios such as avoiding  road debris, yielding for emergency vehicles and adding arrival options to indicate where FSD  should park. We expanded both our service area and fleet count for our Robotaxi service in Austin  and launched our Bay Area ride-hailing service. These efforts help refine our Robotaxi service by  providing valuable real-world data that will allow us to quickly scale to other cities in the future  with our universal model. We announced a deal to manufacture advanced semiconductors for AI  inference and training in the U.S. with Samsung and further expanded our AI training compute  capacity, bringing Cortex to a total of 81k H100 equivalents. Vehicle and Other Software Robotaxi iOS app is now available to everyone in the U.S. and Canada – anyone can download to  join the waitlist. We continue to enhance our vehicles with over-the-air updates, deploying Grok  (an AI companion) for vehicles in North America, Low Power Mode to help conserve energy  (useful when traveling) and Light Sync that synchronizes the car’s interior accent lights with music.  Customers can order food directly from their vehicle touchscreen before arrival at the Tesla Diner  in Los Angeles. Tesla app users can now pinpoint vehicle concerns and diagnose urgent issues to  dispatch mobile technicians to help streamline vehicle service. Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing Both Model 3 and Model Y Standard feature a new battery pack and powertrain designed for  energy and cost efficiency, offering compelling range (321 miles) at an attractive price point. We continue to localize and de-risk our battery and powertrain supply chains across regions,  including progress on raw material, intermediate and final assembly processes in the U.S. and  Europe for both the LFP and nickel supply chains. We expect our lithium refinery in Texas to begin  production in Q4 2025 and our LFP lines in Nevada to begin production Q1 2026.8 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 Existing Capacity 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 FSD Miles on V12 and Beyond FSD Miles on V11 and Before\nE N E R G Y   &   S E R V I C E S   A N D   O T H E R Energy Storage deployments (TTM; GWh) Energy and Services and Other gross profit (TTM; $M) Energy Generation and Storage We achieved our highest quarterly energy storage deployments, bolstered by the continued  ramp of Megafactory Shanghai and another record quarter of Powerwall deployments. Gross  profit increased sequentially and year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion. We unveiled our next-generation industrial storage product, Megablock, a pre-engineered,  medium voltage battery that integrates four Megapack 3s. This new and simplified architecture  incorporates hardware, software and services in a single package up to medium voltage,  enabling rapid utility-scale deployment with faster interconnection to the grid and reduced  complexity for customers. Megapack 3 production will begin at Megafactory Houston in 2026  with up to 50 GWh per year of manufacturing capacity. We recently launched a new lease offering in the U.S. for solar + Powerwall that provides our  customers with predictable energy costs (versus rising utility bills), with attractive features,  including a lower monthly payment compared to loans, a system availability guarantee for the  full lease term and a buyout option after five years. We believe this new lease offering will help  drive incremental demand for our residential energy products.  Services and Other We added over 3,500 net new Supercharging stalls in Q3, growing the network 18% year-over- year. In September, we launched our first v4 Supercharger cabinets with 3x the power density  and 2x the number of stalls per cabinet compared to V3, resulting in higher throughput, higher  efficiency, lower cost and faster deployments. V4 superchargers enable 500kW charging for  passenger vehicles and 1,200kW charging for Tesla Semi, enabling the fastest charging time for  trucks in the U.S. 9 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 -1,000 -500 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500\nO U T L O O K Volume It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost  structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up our vehicle,  energy and other future businesses for growth, the actual results will depend on a variety of factors, including the broader macroeconomic  environment, the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts and production ramp at our factories. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will  manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during periods of uncertainty. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Product We continue to evolve and augment our product lineup with a focus on cost, scale and future monetization opportunities via services  powered by our AI software. We remain focused on growing our sales volumes through a differentiated and efficiently managed product  portfolio, which includes leveraging and optimizing our existing production capacity before building new factories and production lines.  Cybercab, Tesla Semi and Megapack 3 are on schedule for volume production starting in 2026. First generation production lines for  Optimus are being installed in anticipation of volume production. 10\nP H O T O S   &   C H A R T S\nM O D E L   3   &   M O D E L   Y   S T A N D A R D   – T H E   T E S L A   L I N E U P   I S   N O W   M O R E   A F F O R D A B L E 12\nM O D E L   Y   P E R F O R M A N C E   – 0 - 6 0   M P H   I N   3 . 3  S E C O N D S 13\nM O D E L   Y L   – T H E   E X T E N D E D   W H E E L B A S E  ,  T H R E E  - R O W   O P T I O N 14\nM O D E L   Y L   – T H E   E X T E N D E D   W H E E L B A S E  ,  T H R E E  - R O W   O P T I O N 15\nG I G A F A C T O R Y   T E X A S   – 5 0 0 K   V E H I C L E S   P R O D U C E D 16\nO P T I M U S   – A T   T H E   T R O N   A R E S   P R E M I E R E 17\nL A S   M E G A S   – M E G A P A C K   3   L A U N C H   E V E N T 18\nL A S   M E G A S   – M E G A P A C K   3   L A U N C H   T E A M 19\nVehicle Deliveries  (millions of units) K E Y M E T R I C S Q U A R T E R L Y (Unaudited) Operating Cash Flow ($B) Free Cash Flow ($B) (1) Net Income ($B) (2) Adjusted EBITDA ($B) (2) (3) 20 (1) Beginning in Q1'25, Capital expenditures is presented inclusive of purchases of solar energy systems and all prior periods have been adjusted.

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes  both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. “Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) stock-based compensation expense,  net of tax and (b) digital assets (gain) loss, net of tax. \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and  impairment, (d) stock-based compensation expense and (e) digital assets loss (gain), net. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding  operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts  payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant  currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to  common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management  believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that  presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial  metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with  financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment,  deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding  expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories and refinery are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since the 2012 CEO Performance\nAward was last earned in 2017. Despite overwhelming support from you in 2018 and again in 2024, our legal efforts continue in the Delaware\ncourts to reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Despite these legal challenges, we can all agree that Elon has delivered the transformative\nand unprecedented growth that was required to earn all milestones of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This growth has translated into immense\nvalue generated for Tesla and all our shareholders.\nTo recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value\nhe delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018. After all, “a\ndeal is a deal.” Thus, as evidence that Tesla is committed to honoring its promises in the 2018 CEO Performance Award and intends\nto compensate its CEO for his future services commensurate with his contributions to our company and shareholders, we have recommended\nthis award as a first step, “good faith” payment to Elon.\nDelaware litigation continues to loom over us after seven years.\nAs we told you last year, the 2018 CEO Performance Award resulted in\na $2.3 billion stock-based compensation charge to Tesla but brought about $735 billion of increased market capitalization. Despite delivering\nsuch extraordinary returns, that award continues to be in legal limbo despite two separate shareholder votes supporting it by large margins.\nFurthermore, we have no clear timeline for resolution, as we are still waiting not only for a ruling, but a hearing date to be heard in\nfront of the Delaware Supreme Court. Rewarding Elon for what he has done and continues to do for Tesla is the right thing to do.\nRetaining\nElon\nIs More Important Than Ever Before\nToday,\nTesla is at a critical inflection point that has the potential to create continued extraordinary value\nfor you, the shareholders.\nThrough Elon’s unique vision and leadership, Tesla is transitioning from its role as a leader in the electric vehicle and renewable\nenergy industries to grow towards becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services. To succeed, it requires a leader who combines\nstrategic foresight, adaptability, and relentless execution to outperform competition and inspire the team. Elon has demonstrated these\nunmatched leadership abilities time and time again with his unparalleled track record of delivering shareholder value since he joined\nas a founding figure and spearheaded the transformation of our extraordinary company.\nAnd\nwhile these impending changes are exciting, the outcomes\nare not guaranteed.\nIt is imperative to retain and motivate\nour extraordinary talent, beginning with Elon. The war for AI talent is intensifying, with recent months including multi-billion-dollar\nacquisitions of companies and nine-figure cash compensation packages for non-founder, individual AI engineers. Even among this group of\nhighly talented individuals, no one matches Elon’s remarkable combination of leadership experience, technical expertise, and, arguably\nmost importantly, decades-long proven track record of building the most revolutionary and profitable businesses across different industries.\nWhile we recognize that Elon’s business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive\nand wide-ranging, including his leadership roles at xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, X Corp., and The Boring Company as well as his other interests,\nwe are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla and focus his unmatched leadership abilities on further creating\nshareholder value for Tesla shareholders and attracting and retaining talent at Tesla. To be clear, losing Elon would not only mean the\nloss of his talents but also the loss of a leader who is a magnet for hiring and retaining talent at Tesla.\nThe Special Committee believes now is the right time to take decisive\naction to recognize the extraordinary value that Elon created for Tesla shareholders. As such, the Board (with Elon and Kimbal Musk recusing\nthemselves), has unanimously approved a recommendation from the Special Committee of the Board to grant Elon an award of restricted stock\nequal to approximately one-third of the compensation he earned under the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\nThe award provides the following provisions:\n·\n96 million restricted shares of stock, subject to Elon paying a purchase price upon meeting a two-year vesting term, to be delivered\nafter receipt of antitrust regulatory approval;\n·\nThe purchase price will be equal to the split adjusted exercise price of the stock options awarded to Elon under the 2018 CEO Performance\nAward ($23.34 per share);\n·\nA requirement that Elon serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term;\n·\nA pledging allowance to cover tax payments or the purchase price;\n·\nA mandatory holding period of five years from the grant date, except to cover tax payments or the purchase price (with any sales for\nsuch purposes to be conducted through an orderly disposition in coordination with Tesla); and\n·\nIf the Delaware courts fully reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award, this interim award will be forfeited or returned or a portion\nof the 2018 CEO Performance Award will be forfeited.\nTo put it simply, there cannot be any “double dip.”\nElon will\nnot be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts\nrule in our favor.\nThe Special Committee, consisting of the two of us, was formed earlier\nthis year to consider how best to retain and incentivize Elon in a manner that aligned with the best interests of the Company. The Special\nCommittee and the Board deliberated carefully over the decision to grant this interim award against the backdrop of the ever-intensifying\nAI talent war and Tesla’s position at a critical inflection point. We believe it directly addresses a top concern and priority for\nshareholders and the Board alike: energizing and focusing Elon on Tesla so he can propel Tesla into its next era of growth, while we continue\nthe legal campaign to have the 2018 CEO Performance Award reinstated. This interim award is structured to incrementally increase his voting\nrights upon grant, which he has repeatedly told us—and shareholders have confirmed—is an important part of incentivizing him\nto stay focused on the critical work we are doing here at Tesla. We believe this is a vital consideration, and we used the tools currently\navailable to us—our existing equity incentive plan—to grant this award.\nWe would also like to stress that prior to recommending this award,\nwe reviewed your letters, read your X posts, and considered the direct feedback we have received from many of you in order to align our\nrecommendation with your expressed views. From those communications, we know that one of your top concerns is keeping Elon’s energies\nfocused on Tesla. This award is a critical first step toward achieving that goal, although it is limited by the capacity of our current\nequity incentive plan. As such, we are also working on next steps to address that issue. Still, while our work remains ongoing, we feel\nit is important to communicate directly and transparently with you all, our shareholders and Tesla’s owners.\nThe Special Committee continues our work to address a longer-term CEO\ncompensation strategy, which we plan to put to a shareholder vote at the November 6 annual meeting.\nThank you for your continued support of Tesla and stay tuned for more\ninformation as we get closer to our shareholder meeting.\nVery truly yours,\nRobyn Denholm & Kathleen Wilson-Thompson\nMembers of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "50e8aece9eb27154b8a7a7ec94a13e2cce810f5351d6b07f55dea4cc7cc92602"}

Profitability $0.9B GAAP operating income $1.2B GAAP net income $1.4B non-GAAP net income1 Q2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla’s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the  electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and  related services. Our first Robotaxi service launched in Austin in June. While the service is  limited in initial scope, we believe our approach to autonomy – a camera-only architecture with  neural networks trained on data from our global fleet of millions of vehicles – allows us to  continually improve safety, rapidly scale the network and improve profitability. We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in  June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025. Additionally, we continued  development of Semi and Cybercab, both slated for volume production in 2026. The Energy business is more critical than ever. The availability of clean, reliable energy is  necessary for economic growth and an imperative for the development and commercialization  of AI enabled products and services. As electricity demand grows, our Megapack product helps  to increase utilization of existing generation and transmission capacity, resulting in a more  efficient use of the electric grid. When paired with solar PV, Megapack is cost competitive with  traditional fossil fuel generation assets and can be deployed 4x faster than traditional fossil fuel  plants of the same capacity. Trailing twelve-month Energy storage deployments achieved their  12th consecutive quarterly record. Despite a sustained uncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs,  unclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment, we continue to make high- value investments in CapEx and R&D, while ensuring a strong balance sheet. Our priorities  remain the same: delivering affordable and compelling autonomy-capable models that  maximize our global fleet of vehicles as our autonomy software continues to rapidly progress,  growing the Energy business and advancing our robotics efforts.

YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: - decline in vehicle deliveries - lower regulatory credit revenue - reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) (excl. FX impact1), due to mix - decline in Energy Generation and Storage revenue due to lower ASP + growth in Services and Other Profitability Our operating income decreased 42% YoY to $0.9B, resulting in a 4.1% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted  by the following items: - lower regulatory credit revenue - increase in operating expenses (ex. restructuring and SBC) driven by AI and other R&D projects - decline in vehicle deliveries - increase in SBC + decrease in restructuring charges + lower cost per vehicle, due to mix and lower raw materials partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption and an increase in tariffs + growth in Energy Generation and Storage gross profit Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments was $36.8B. The sequential decrease of $0.2B was primarily the result of changes in  restricted cash and cash used in financing activities partially offset by free cash flow. 5 (1) Impact is calculated on a constant currency basis.

Our  entire model lineup is better than ever with recent updates. Our ongoing focus on supply chain  robustness has enabled a resilient vehicle capacity base despite trade and policy uncertainties.  We produced our 8-millionth vehicle in June. US: California, Nevada and Texas We had record test drives in North America, up 20% sequentially. Given the recent refreshes in  our product portfolio and rapid improvement in FSD (Supervised)1, it is paramount we maximize  the number of prospective customers experiencing our vehicles. In May, the team launched the  Long Range RWD Model Y with 357 miles of range, starting under $45k before incentives,  opening the Model Y portfolio to more potential buyers. APAC: Shanghai Gigafactory Shanghai remains our main export hub and continues to support greater market  expansion. We achieved record delivery volumes in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and  Singapore. In July, we launched the Model Y in India, marking our entry into the world’s third- largest car market. The refreshed Model 3 earned a 5-star Overall Safety Rating from ANCAP,  achieving 95% in the Child Occupant Protection pillar – the highest result recorded to date  against ANCAP’s 2023-2025 criteria. We continue to prepare for broader release of FSD  (Supervised)1 in China this year, pending regulatory approval. Europe and the Middle East: Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in Norway YTD and in Türkiye, Netherlands, Switzerland and  Austria in June. The refreshed Model 3 achieved a 5-star Overall Safety Rating from EuroNCAP  and is the safest car in Europe based on the latest EuroNCAP test scores. We continue to  prepare for the launch of FSD (Supervised)1 in Europe this year, pending regulatory approval. 7 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China\nTesla AI training capacity ramp through end of September (H100 equivalent GPUs) C O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised)1 (billions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware In June, we launched our Robotaxi service in the first city, Austin, with a safety rider. We will  further improve and expand the service (more vehicles covering a larger area, eventually without  a safety rider) while testing in other U.S. cities in anticipation of additional launches. Our efforts to  refine the Robotaxi offering in Austin are not location-specific and will allow us to scale to other  cities quickly with marginal investment. We achieved the world's first autonomous delivery to a  customer with a new production Model Y driving itself ~30 minutes from the factory across town  to its new owner's home, including on highways. We expanded AI training compute with an  additional 16k H200 GPUs at Gigafactory Texas, bringing Cortex to a total of 67k H100 equivalents. Vehicle and Other Software Our cars get better over time: a 2017 Model 3 owner today has access to features that did not  exist when their car was built - improved security and safety (Sentry Mode, Dashcam Viewer,  Automatic Blind Spot Camera, Dog Mode), increased convenience (Tesla Profiles, mobile app Trip  Planner, battery preconditioning for faster Supercharging) and entertainment options (Netflix,  YouTube, etc.) among many others – all delivered for free via software updates. We launched the Robotaxi mobile app, which leverages existing Tesla app features and provides a  seamless customer experience. With a Tesla Profile, customers can request a ride, follow the  vehicle’s location, preset cabin temperature, unlock the car using their phone, have access to  their favorite entertainment and securely pay for the ride with their payment profile.  Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing Our lithium refining and cathode production plants remain on track to begin production in 2025,  on-shoring production of critical battery materials to the U.S. We are on course to begin domestic  production of our first LFP cells for our energy storage products later this year. 8 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 FSD Miles on V12 and Beyond FSD Miles on V11 and Before 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 Existing Capacity Future Planned Capacity\nE N E R G Y   &   S E R V I C E S   A N D   O T H E R Energy Storage deployments (TTM; GWh) Energy and Services and Other gross profit (TTM; $M) Energy storage deployments continue to grow as we expand capacity for both Megapack and  Powerwall to meet demand globally. Services and Other – a collection of businesses that mainly  supports vehicle sales – also continues to grow alongside our global fleet of vehicles. Energy Generation and Storage Energy storage deployments once again increased on a trailing twelve-month (TTM) basis,  including record Powerwall deployments for the fifth consecutive quarter. Gross profit increased  sequentially and year-over-year, reaching a record of $846 million. We started deploying  Megapacks from Megafactory Shanghai as the ramp continues as planned. Regionalizing energy  storage manufacturing capacity is critical for meeting demand given shifting tariff, trade and  fiscal policies globally. Services and Other Services and Other gross profit grew 64% sequentially, partly due to improved Supercharging  gross profit generation from increased volume. We added over 2,900 net new Supercharging  stalls, growing the network 18% year-over-year.  As we continue redefining the vehicle buying and ownership experience, we have integrated AI  agents to help resolve customer queries, reduce wait times for service and even provide  assistance when placing an order for accessories, parts and products without having to wait for a  person. We are leveraging this same technology in our service technician workflow to help  improve turnaround times for service.  9 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 -1,000 -500 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000\nO U T L O O K Volume It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost  structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle  and energy businesses for growth, the actual results will depend on a variety of factors, including the broader macroeconomic  environment, the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts and production ramp at our factories. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will  manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Product Our focus remains on prudently growing our vehicle volumes in a capex efficient manner by using our existing vehicle production capacity  before building new lines. Plans for new vehicles that will launch in 2025 remain on track, including initial production of a more affordable  model in 1H25.  Our purpose-built Robotaxi product – Cybercab – will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy and is  scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.  10\nP H O T O S   &   C H A R T S\nT H E   T E S L A   E C O S Y S T E M   – C R E A T I N G   A   C L E A N E R ,   S A F E R ,   M O R E   E N J O Y A B L E   W O R L D 12\nF S D  ( S U P E R V I S E D ) 1 T E S T I N G   – P A R I S ,   L O N D O N ,   S Y D N E Y   A N D   R O M E   ( C L O C K W I S E ) 13 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous\nF I R S T   A U T O N O M O U S   D E L I V E R Y   O F   A   V E H I C L E   – M O D E L   Y   I N   A U S T I N ,   TX 14\nT E S L A   D I N E R   – F I R S T   R E S P O N D E R S   E V E N T 15\nT E S L A   D I N E R   – N O W   O P E N   F O R   C H A R G I N G ,   D I N I N G   A N D   E N T E R T A I N M E N T 16 Source: @JEHazel75 via x.com\nT E S L A   D I N E R   – N O W   O P E N   F O R   C H A R G I N G ,   D I N I N G   A N D   E N T E R T A I N M E N T 17\nT E S L A   D I N E R   – C A R - S I D E   F O O D   D E L I V E R Y 18\nP R O G R E S S   O N   W O R L D ’ S   L A R G E S T   S U P E R C H A R G E R   S I T E   – L O S T   H I L L S ,   C A   |   1 6 8   S T A L L S   P O W E R E D   B Y   S O L A R   A N D   M E G A P A C K 19\nG I G A F A C T O R Y   B E R L I N - B R A N D E N B E R G   – P R O D U C E D   T E S L A ’ S   8 - M I L L I O N T H   V E H I C L E 20\nVehicle Deliveries  (millions of units) K E Y M E T R I C S Q U A R T E R L Y (Unaudited) Operating Cash Flow ($B) Free Cash Flow ($B) (1) Net Income ($B) (2) Adjusted EBITDA ($B) (2) (3) 21 (1) Beginning in Q1'25, Capital expenditures is presented inclusive of purchases of solar energy systems and all prior periods have been adjusted.

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes  both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. “Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) stock-based compensation expense,  net of tax and (b) digital assets loss (gain), net of tax. \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and  impairment, (d) stock-based compensation expense and (e) digital assets loss (gain), net. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding  operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts  payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant  currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to  common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management  believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that  presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial  metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with  financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment,  deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding  expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories and refinery are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Excluding Cybertruck and unscheduled downtime, our COGS4 per unit declined sequentially, driven primarily by lower raw material costs.  Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs. While positive for our regulatory credits business, we prefer the industry to continue pushing EV adoption, which is in-line with our mission. To support our growth, we have been increasing awareness and expanding vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers. While many are pulling back on their investments, we are investing in future growth – including our AI infrastructure, production capacity, our Supercharger and service networks and new products infrastructure – with $2.8B of capital expenditures in Q1.   We recently undertook a cost-cutting exercise to increase operational efficiency. We also remain committed to company-wide cost reduction, including reducing COGS per vehicle. Ultimately, we are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products.  The future is not only electric, but also autonomous. We believe scaled autonomy is only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster. We have, and continue to expand, both. To make FSD (Supervised) 5 more accessible, we reduced the price of subscription to $99/month and the purchase price to $8,000 in the US.

Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on latest available data from ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light-duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months A sequential decline in volumes was partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and from an arson attack.  US: California, Nevada and Texas Model 3 production in Fremont was down sequentially as we changed the production line to the updated model. Sequentially, Model Y production at Gigafactory Texas increased to an all-time high, while COGS per unit improved to an all-time low. The Cybertruck ramp continued successfully at Gigafactory Texas, with a sequential cost improvement in Q1. We produced over 1,000 Cybertrucks in a single week in April. China: Shanghai Production at Gigafactory Shanghai was down sequentially due to seasonality and planned shutdowns around Chinese New Year in Q1. Demand typically improves throughout the year. As we enter new markets, such as Chile, many of them will be supplied from Gigafactory Shanghai.  Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y production in Berlin was down sequentially due to impacts from the Red Sea conflict and the arson attack that impacted the factory. Despite idle capacity charges and other costs from production disruptions, COGS per unit continued to decline sequentially.\nTesla AI Training Capacity (H100 Equivalent GPUs) C O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta (billions; as of Apr-21-24) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware We have been investing in the hardware and software ecosystems necessary to achieve vehicle autonomy and a ride-hailing service. We believe a scalable and profitable autonomy business can be realized through a vision-only architecture with end-to-end neural networks, trained on billions of miles of real-world data. Since the launch of FSD (Supervised) V12 earlier this year, it has become clear that this architecture long pursued by Tesla is the right solution for scalable autonomy. To further improve our end-to-end training capability, we will continue to increase our core AI infrastructure capacity in the coming months. In Q1, we completed the transition to Hardware 4.0, our latest in-vehicle computer with increased inference processing power and improved cameras. Vehicle and Other Software We rolled out FSD (Supervised) with a 30-day free trial to eligible cars in U.S. and Canada. FSD (Supervised) can change lanes, select forks to follow routes, navigate around vehicles and objects and make turns. We released Autopark to existing eligible FSD (Supervised) and Enhanced Autopilot customers. We are currently working on ride-hailing functionality that will be available in the future. We believe the Tesla software experience is best-in-class across all our products, and plan to seamlessly layer ride-hailing into the Tesla App. Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing 4680 ramp continued successfully in Q1 and continues to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp. Costs continued to come down sequentially as scrap, yield and production rate improved.\nO T H E R   H I G H L I G H T S Energy Storage deployments (GWh) Non-Automotive gross profit ($M) Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla. As Megapack continues to ramp and as our fleet continues to grow, we are expecting consistent profit growth of our non-automotive business.  Energy Generation and Storage Energy storage deployments increased sequentially in Q1 to a record 4.1 GWh. Energy Generation and Storage revenue and gross profit also achieved an all-time high in Q1. Revenues were up 7% YoY and gross profit was up 140% YoY, driven by increased Megapack deployments, partially offset by a decrease in solar deployments. Energy Generation and Storage remains our highest margin business. Our second general assembly line is now commissioned, and we continue to ramp our 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity. Services and Other  Services and Other revenue grew 25% YoY in Q1, while gross profit was down 40% YoY. The biggest driver of gross profit reduction YoY was lower used vehicle profit, partially offset by growth in gross profit from part sales. Starting at the end of February, we began opening our North American Supercharger Network to more non-Tesla EV owners. We will continue to onboard OEMs who have committed to NACS over the coming quarters, while also opening more sites to other EVs in regions outside North America, both of which should drive incremental revenue and profit generation.\nO U T L O O K Volume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next generation vehicle and other products. In 2024, the growth rates of energy storage deployments and revenue in our Energy Generation and Storage business should outpace the Automotive business. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Product We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025. These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up. This update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This would help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new manufacturing lines. Our purpose-built robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy.\nP H O T O S   &   C H A R T S\nE L E C T R I C   V E H I C L E   A D O P T I O N   R A T E   R E M A I N S   U N D E R   P R E S S U R E ,   E S P E C I A L L Y   O U T S I D E   O F   C H I N A Global BEV market share* (12-months trailing) China World ex-China *Source: ev-volumes.com and https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/finance-2/key-figures/monthly-sales/\nT H E   T E S L A   E C O S Y S T E M   -   M O R E   T H A N   J U S T   V E H I C L E S\nM O D E L   3   -   S T A R T I N G   A T   $ 2 9 9 / M O   I N   T H E   U .

webcast of its first quarter 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on April 23, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.   CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 26, 2024. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "sublinks": [{"url": "https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/finance-2/key-figures/monthly-sales/", "extracted_text": "Skip to main content\nLoading...\nEN\nChoose a language\nAccessibility\nOn\nOff\nGroup\nBrands\nResponsibility\nMagazine\nReveal Twingo\nCareers\nInvestors\nPress\nInvestors\nKey figures\nMonthly sales\nMonthly sales\nMonthly sales\nThere are no available documents.", "fetch_status": "ok", "similarity_to_main": 0.05506652117899513}], "content_hash": "70c3f3578a63882cf393c58414cbab34f2b5059053cf82d37ecc7cbdcea3d19d"}

For a long time, many doubted the viability of EVs. Today, the best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV.  Free cash flow remained strong in 2023 at $4.4B, even as we focused on future growth projects with our highest capital expenditures and R&D expenses in company history. Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023, more than double compared to the previous year, while Energy Generation and Storage business profits nearly quadrupled in 2023. Gross profit of our Services & Other business increased from a ~$500M loss in 2019 to a ~$500M profit in 2023.  Cost of goods sold per vehicle5 declined sequentially in Q4. Our team remains focused on growing our output, investing in our future growth and finding additional cost efficiencies in 2024. In late December, we started rolling out V12 of FSD Beta6. Trained on data from a fleet of over a million vehicles, this system uses AI to influence vehicle controls (steering wheel, pedals, indicators, etc.) instead of hard-coding every driving behavior. V12 marks a new era in the path to full autonomy. We are focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas. This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.  Cash Operating cash flow of $13.3B; free cash flow2 of $4.4B in 2023 Operating cash flow of $4.4B; free cash flow of $2.1B in Q4 $3.0B increase in our cash and investments3 in Q4 to $29.1B Operations Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in the world4 Energy storage deployment of 14.7 GWh in 2023, 125% growth\nF I N A N C I A L   S U M M A R Y (Unaudited) ($ in millions, except percentages and per share data) Q4-2022 Q1-2023 Q2-2023 Q3-2023 Q4-2023 YoY Total automotive revenues 21,307 19,963 21,268 19,625 21,563 1% Energy generation and storage revenue 1,310 1,529 1,509 1,559 1,438 10% Services and other revenue 1,701 1,837 2,150 2,166 2,166 27%         Total revenues 24,318 23,329 24,927 23,350 25,167 3% Total gross profit 5,777 4,511 4,533 4,178 4,438 -23% Total GAAP gross margin 23.8% 19.3% 18.2% 17.9% 17.6% -612 bp           Operating expenses 1,876 1,847 2,134 2,414 2,374 27% Income from operations 3,901 2,664 2,399 1,764 2,064 -47% Operating margin 16.0% 11.4% 9.6% 7.6% 8.2% -784 bp           Adjusted EBITDA 5,404 4,267 4,653 3,758 3,953 -27% Adjusted EBITDA margin 22.2% 18.3% 18.7% 16.1% 15.7% -652 bp           Net income attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) 3,687 2,513 2,703 1,853 7,928 115% Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP) 4,106 2,931 3,148 2,318 2,485 -39%           EPS attributable to common stockholders, diluted (GAAP) 1.07 0.73 0.78 0.53 2.27 112% EPS attributable to common stockholders, diluted (non-GAAP) 1.19 0.85 0.91 0.66 0.71 -40%           Net cash provided by operating activities 3,278 2,513 3,065 3,308 4,370 33% Capital expenditures (1,858) (2,072) (2,060) (2,460) (2,306) 24% Free cash flow 1,420 441 1,005 848 2,064 45% Cash, cash equivalents and investments 22,185 22,402 23,075 26,077 29,094 31%\nF I N A N C I A L   S U M M A R Y (Unaudited) ($ in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 YoY Total automotive revenues          20,821         27,236        47,232         71,462         82,419 15% Energy generation and storage revenue               1,531            1,994           2,789           3,909           6,035 54% Services and other revenue 2,226 2,306 3,802 6,091 8,319 37% Total revenues           24,578          31,536            53,823            81,462 96,773 19% Total gross profit             4,069              6,630            13,606            20,853 17,660 -15% Total GAAP gross margin 16.6% 21.0% 25.3% 25.6% 18.2%        -735 bp Operating expenses             4,138             4,636              7,083              7,197 8,769 22% (Loss) income from operations                 (69)             1,994              6,523            13,656 8,891 -35% Operating margin -0.3% 6.3% 12.1% 16.8% 9.2%        -758 bp Adjusted EBITDA 2,985 5,817 11,621 19,186 16,631 -13% Adjusted EBITDA margin 12.1% 18.4% 21.6% 23.6% 17.2%        -637 bp Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) (862) 721 5,519 12,556 14,997 19% Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP) 36 2,455 7,640 14,116 10,882 -23% EPS attributable to common stockholders, diluted (GAAP) (0.33) 0.21              1.63             3.62 4.30 19% EPS attributable to common stockholders, diluted (non-GAAP) 0.01 0.75             2.26            4.07 3.12 -23% Net cash provided by operating activities 2,405 5,943 11,497 14,724 13,256 -10% Capital expenditures (1,327) (3,157) (6,482) (7,158) (8,898) 24% Free cash flow 1,078 2,786 5,015 7,566 4,358 -42% Cash, cash equivalents and investments 6,268 19,384 17,707 22,185 29,094 31%\nF I N A N C I A L   S U M M A R Y Revenue Total revenue grew 3% YoY in Q4 to $25.2B.

Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on latest available data from ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light-duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months After our scheduled global factory shutdown in Q3, our global production reached a record annualized run rate of nearly 2.0 million vehicles in Q4. The refreshed Model 3 - with a significantly quieter cabin, ventilated seats, a screen for rear seats, longer range and many other improvements - is now available globally. US: California, Nevada and Texas Before Tesla purchased the Fremont factory, the record output of the previous owner was nearly 430,000 vehicles made in a single year. In 2023, the Tesla Fremont factory produced nearly 560,000 vehicles thanks to our ~20,000 Fremont-based employees. At Gigafactory Texas, we began production of the Cybertruck and delivered the first units to customers. We expect the ramp of Cybertruck to be longer than other models given its manufacturing complexity. China: Shanghai Shanghai resumed normal rate production in Q4, rebounding from the scheduled downtime in Q3. Production of the updated Model 3 ramped to full speed in less than two months. Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y production in Berlin continued to grow in Q4, achieving both a record weekly production rate and a sequential increase in total production volume for the seventh consecutive quarter.\nCost of goods sold per vehicle C O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta (millions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware In Q4, we released our latest FSD Beta software (V12) to select Tesla employees, and more recently, to customers. V12 utilizes end-to-end training, enhancing the driving experience. We also introduced the 2nd generation of the Optimus robot, which uses Tesla-designed actuators and sensors and improved AI capabilities. Both FSD Beta and Optimus are trained with similar technology pillars: real-world data, neural net training and cutting-edge hardware and software. Vehicle and Other Software We delivered the Cybertruck with an all-new user interface and new communication bus, Etherloop, that efficiently moves data while significantly reducing wiring. As part of our holiday update, when parking, Tesla vehicles without ultrasonic sensors display a high-fidelity 3D rendering of the vehicle's surroundings, including nearby barriers, vehicles and painted markings. Wireless Bluetooth headphones can also now be paired with the rear screen when watching shows or playing games. FleetAPI now enables third-party solutions that enhance integration and management of Tesla devices. Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially to slightly above $36,000. Even as we approach the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup, our team continues to focus on further cost reductions across all points of production, from raw materials to final delivery.\nO T H E R   H I G H L I G H T S Services & Other gross profit ($M) Energy Storage Energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q4 to 3.2 GWh, for a total deployment of 14.7 GWh in 2023, a 125% increase compared to 2022. While we expect deployments will continue to be volatile on a sequential basis, impacted by logistics and the global distribution of projects at any given time, we expect continued growth on a trailing twelve-month basis going forward. We continue to ramp our 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity. Solar Solar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 41 MW. Downward pressure on solar demand continued into Q4 as interest rates have remained high. Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower deployments and seasonal weakness in solar energy generation. Services and Other business  The Services and Other business continued to grow alongside our fleet in 2023, achieving record revenue and gross profit generation. The biggest drivers of profit generation in 2023 were part sales, used vehicle sales, merchandise sales and pay-per-use supercharging. As our fleet continues to expand in the coming years, there is an opportunity for fleet-related services to become a more meaningful driver of profit generation. Energy Storage deployments (GWh)\nO U T L O O K Volume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas. In 2024, the growth rate of deployments and revenue in our Energy Storage business should outpace the Automotive business. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.  Product Cybertruck production and deliveries will ramp throughout this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.\nP H O T O S   &   C H A R T S\nM O D E L   Y   -   B E S T - S E L L I N G   V E H I C L E   G L O B A L L Y   I N   2 0 2

D D I T I O N A L   I N F O R M A T I O N WEBCAST INFORMATION Tesla will provide a live webcast of its fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on January 24, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.   CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements.

Our cost of goods sold per vehicle4 decreased to ~$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our  new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary  upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry  leader needs to be a cost leader. During a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and  capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the  right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached $2.3B while our cash and  investments position continues to improve. We have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our  growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being  trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being  further upgraded. Lastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over $0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and  Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our  profitability.

We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across  the quarter, with September accounting for ~40% of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September  accounting for ~65% of Q3 deliveries in 2022. US: California, Nevada and Texas At Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial  deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its  current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher  density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and  lithium refining in the U.S. China: Shanghai Other than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity  for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga  Shanghai remains our main export hub. Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available  data as of August).

Customers  who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental  car feel like their own. The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule  service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage drop-off/pickup. Prospective customers can  similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing Despite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories,  our average vehicle cost was ~$37,500, and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy  vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will adopt  an 800-volt architecture. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 $36,000 $36,500 $37,000 $37,500 $38,000 $38,500 $39,000 $39,500 $40,000 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023\nO T H E R   H I G H L I G H T S 9 Services & Other gross profit ($M) Energy Storage Energy storage deployments increased by 90% YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest quarterly deployment ever.  Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward  full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3. Solar Solar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end  of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand. Services and Other business As our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow successfully, with  Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay-per-use  Supercharging remains a profitable business for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures.

N WEBCAST INFORMATION Tesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 18, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income  (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also  facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such  information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see  through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be  read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and  improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our  battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking  statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without  limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost- effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices,  quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including  through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and  confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel  and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and  financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk  Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 25", "sublinks": [{"url": "https://www.tesla.com/support/incentives", "extracted_text": null, "fetch_status": "extract_failed", "similarity_to_main": 0.0}], "content_hash": "26bc9e9970d9024a7a76da5fb0438f01365006a5c82f1e3f894f8980507707ae"}

McCormick (the “Settlement Hearing”) in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, 500 North King Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.  The purpose of the Settlement Hearing to be held by the Court is to determine whether:   (i) Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel have adequately represented the interests of Tesla and its stockholders; (ii) the proposed settlement of the Action should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of Tesla and its stockholders; (iii) the Action should be dismissed with prejudice and all Released Claims against Released Persons should be fully, finally, and forever released, settled, and discharged; (iv) whether and in what amount any Fee and Expense Award should be paid to Plaintiff’s Counsel out of the Settlement Option Amount; and (v) Final Judgment approving the Settlement of the Action should be entered in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation.\nPLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS NOTICE RELATES TO A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THE LITIGATION REFERRED TO IN THE CAPTION AND CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS.  IF THE COURT APPROVES THE SETTLEMENT, YOU WILL BE FOREVER BARRED FROM CONTESTING THE FAIRNESS, REASONABLENESS, OR ADEQUACY OF THE SETTLEMENT, AND FROM PURSUING THE RELEASED PLAINTIFF PArties’ CLAIMS.\nThe Stipulation was entered into as of July 14, 2023, by and among (i) plaintiff, the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (“Plaintiff”), derivatively on behalf of Tesla, Inc. (f/k/a Tesla Motors, Inc.) (“Tesla”) pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; (ii) non-employee former and current Tesla directors Brad Buss, Robyn M. Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Lawrence J. Ellison, Antonio J. Gracias, Stephen T. Jurvetson, Kimbal Musk, James Murdoch, Linda Johnson Rice,\n-\n2\n-\nKathleen Wilson-Thompson, and Hiromichi Mizuno (collectively, “Director Defendants”); and (iii) fellow Tesla director and Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk (“Musk” and, together with Director Defendants, “Defendants”) (collectively, Defendants and Tesla are referred to as “Settling Defendants” and, together with Plaintiff, “Settling Parties”).\nThis Notice describes the rights you may have in the Action and pursuant to the Stipulation and what steps you may take, but are not required to take, in relation to the Settlement.  If the Court approves the Settlement, Settling Parties will ask the Court at the Settlement Hearing to enter Final Judgment dismissing the Action with prejudice in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation.\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE?\nThe purpose of this Notice is to explain the Action, the terms of the proposed Settlement, and how the Settlement affects the legal rights of Tesla stockholders.  In a derivative action, one or more persons or entities who are current stockholders of a corporation sue on behalf of and for the benefit of the corporation, seeking to enforce the corporation’s legal rights.\nAs described more fully below, stockholders have the right to object to the proposed Settlement and the Fee and Expense Application by Plaintiff’s Counsel for an award of reasonable fees and expenses (the “Fee and Expense Award”).  Stockholders have the right to appear and be heard at the Settlement Hearing, which will be held before The Honorable Kathaleen St. J. McCormick on October 13, 2023, at 1:30 pm ET in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, 500 North King Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.\nThe Court has reserved the right to adjourn and reconvene the Settlement Hearing, including consideration of the Fee and Expense Application, without further notice of any kind other than oral announcement at the Settlement Hearing or any adjournment thereof, or notation on the docket in the Action.  The Court has further reserved the right to approve the Settlement, according to the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, with such modifications as may be consented to by Settling Parties, or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the Stipulation, with or without future notice to Tesla stockholders.  The Court may enter Final Judgment, and order the payment of the Fee and Expense Award, all without future notice to Tesla stockholders.\n-\n3\n-\nWHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?\nTHE FOLLOWING RECITATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE COURT AND SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES BY ANY OF SETTLING PARTIES.  IT IS BASED ON STATEMENTS OF SETTLING PARTIES AND IS SENT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFORMING YOU OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACTION AND OF A HEARING ON A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT SO THAT YOU MAY MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS AS TO STEPS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WISH TO TAKE IN RELATION TO THIS LITIGATION.\nBetween June 17, 2017 and the present (“Relevant Period”), Director Defendants were granted certain options and cash during their service on the Tesla Board (“Relevant Period Director Compensation”).\nOn June 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed a derivative complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging breach of fiduciary duty against Defendants and unjust enrichment against Director Defendants relating to Director Defendants’ compensation.\nOn September 17, 2020, Defendants served their Answer and Affirmative Defenses to the Complaint, and nominal defendant Tesla served its answer to the Complaint.\nOn October 29, 2020, Plaintiff served a first request for production of documents on Settling Defendants; and Defendants served a first request for production of documents on Plaintiff.\nOn November 13, 2020, Settling Parties filed a stipulation and proposed scheduling order, which the Court granted the same day.\nOn November 30, 2020, Settling Defendants served responses and objections to Plaintiff’s first request for production; and Plaintiff served responses and objections to Defendants’ first request for production.\nOn April 9, 2021, Settling Parties filed an amended stipulation and proposed scheduling order, which the Court granted on May 3, 2021.\n-\n4\n-\nIn June 2021 and May 2022, the Tesla Board unanimously approved and adopted resolutions to forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under Tesla’s Outside Director Compensation Policy (or otherwise previously approved by the Tesla Board) until July 2023 (“2021 and 2022 Foregone Options”).\nOn September 9, 2021, Plaintiff served a first set of interrogatories on Settling Defendants.  Settling Defendants served their responses and objections between November 12, 2021, and December 17, 2021.\nOn July 29, 2022, the Parties were notified that the case was reassigned to Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick.\nOn September 13, 2022, Plaintiff served a second set of interrogatories on Settling Defendants.  Settling Defendants served their responses and objections between October 20, 2022, and April 5, 2023, and certain Defendants served amended responses and objections on January 27, 2023.\nOn September 23, 2022, Plaintiff served a third set of interrogatories.  Tesla served its responses and objections on October 24, 2022.\nOn October 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the production of certain documents by Settling Defendants.  Following briefing and a hearing, on January 31, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff’s motion.\nOn October 26, 2022, Plaintiff served a fourth set of interrogatories on Tesla.  On November 28, 2022, Tesla served its responses and objections, which it amended on February 14, 2023.\nBetween December 2022 and April 2023, Plaintiff deposed 22 fact witnesses, including each Defendant.\nSettling Defendants produced documents to Plaintiff, with the first production of documents on December 14, 2020, and the last production of documents on March 23, 2023.\nOn March 29, 2023, Plaintiff served a first request for admission on Settling Defendants.  On April 28, 2023, Settling Defendants served their responses and objections.\nOn April 14, 2023, Plaintiff served contention interrogatories on Settling Defendants.  On June 2, 2023, Settling Defendants served their responses and objections.\n-\n5\n-\nOn April 20, 2023, Plaintiff served a second request for admission on Settling Defendants.  On May 26, 2023, Settling Defendants served their responses and objections.\nPlaintiff served numerous third-party subpoenas and obtained third-party document productions between November 10, 2021 and May 1, 2023.\nOn April 28, 2023, Plaintiff served the opening expert reports of Jesse M. Fried, Carl S. Saba, and David L. Yermack, and Defendants served the opening expert report of Kevin J. Murphy.  On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff served the rebuttal expert report of Jesse M. Fried, and Defendants served the rebuttal expert report of Kevin J. Murphy.\nBeginning in November 2022, Plaintiff and Defendants from time to time engaged in arm’s-length negotiations in efforts to settle Plaintiff’s Claims without involvement of the Court.  These efforts included participation in several mediation sessions before JAMS Mediator Robert A. Meyer, as well as numerous other settlement communications between Plaintiff and Defendants facilitated by Mr. Meyer.\nOn June 20, 2023, following extensive negotiations, Settling Parties accepted a recommendation from Mr. Meyer relating to the Settlement Options and foregone compensation. On June 28, 2023, following further negotiations, Settling Parties agreed to the corporate governance reforms covered by the Stipulation. With Mr. Meyer’s assistance, the Setting Parties finalized their negotiations of the Stipulation terms.\nOn July 14, 2023, Plaintiff and Settling Defendants entered into the Stipulation.\nThe Stipulation is intended fully, finally and forever to release, resolve, compromise, settle, and discharge the Released Claims and terminate the Action with prejudice.  It is the intention of Plaintiff and Settling Defendants that the Settlement will release the Released Claims against Released Persons upon Final Approval of the Stipulation.\nThe entry by Settling Parties into the Stipulation is not, and shall not be construed as or deemed to be evidence of, an admission as to the merit or lack of merit of any Claims or defenses asserted in the Action.\nPlaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel have conducted discovery relating to the events and transactions underlying Plaintiff’s claims.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s\n-\n6\n-\nCounsel believe that they have meritorious claims and could prevail at trial.   Nevertheless, based upon their evaluation of Settling Parties’ claims and defenses, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel have determined that the Settlement terms set forth in the Stipulation are fair, reasonable, and adequate and that the Settlement confers substantial benefits upon Tesla and its stockholders given the costs, delay, and risk of continued litigation.\nSettling Defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage whatsoever.  Specifically, Settling Defendants deny that they breached any duties.  Settling Defendants also maintain that they have meritorious defenses to all claims alleged in the Action and could prevail at trial.  Settling Defendants also deny that Tesla or its stockholders were harmed by any conduct of Settling Defendants alleged in the Action or that could have been alleged.  Each of Settling Defendants asserts that, at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders.  Nevertheless, based upon their evaluation of Settling Parties’ claims and defenses, Settling Defendants, wishing to eliminate the uncertainty, risk, burden, and expense of further litigation to themselves and to Tesla, have therefore determined to settle the Action on the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation.  Nothing in the Stipulation shall be construed as any admission by Settling Defendants of wrongdoing, fault, liability, or damages whatsoever.  Nothing in the Stipulation shall be construed as an allocation of fault or liability between or among the Settling Defendants.\nSettling Parties recognize that the Action has been filed and prosecuted by Plaintiff in good faith and defended by Settling Defendants in good faith and further that the terms of the Settlement as set forth herein, were negotiated at arm’s length, were negotiated in good faith, and reflect an agreement reached voluntarily, based on the recommendation of a neutral mediator and after consultation with experienced legal counsel.\nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT?\nIn consideration for the full and final release, settlement, and discharge of any and all Released Claims against Released Persons upon Final Approval, Settling Parties have agreed to the following consideration:\nDirector Defendants shall, jointly and severally, provide to Tesla the value of 3,130,406 options (“Settlement Options”) using the methods set forth in Section 2\n-\n7\n-\nof the Stipulation, which shall have the total value set forth in Section 2.6 of the Stipulation.\nDirector Defendants shall return the Settlement Options in the form of (i) cash (“Returned Cash”), (ii) unrestricted common shares of Tesla stock (“Returned Stock”), and/or (iii) unexercised Tesla options awarded as compensation to the Director Defendants during the Relevant Period (“Returned Options”).  The Director Defendants shall have sole discretion on the ratio of Returned Cash, Returned Stock, and Returned Options that they provide to Tesla, provided that the total value of Returned Cash, Returned Stock, and Returned Options, using the methods set forth in Section 2 of the Stipulation, equals $735,266,505 (seven hundred thirty-five million, two hundred sixty-six thousand, five hundred five U.S. Dollars), which is referred to as the Settlement Option Amount (as defined in Section 2.6 of the Stipulation).\nThe value of each Returned Option shall be the difference between the Settlement Stock Price and the actual strike price of each Returned Option.  Tesla shall cause the Returned Options to be canceled on the next Business Day after Final Approval, subject to Section 7.3 of the Stipulation.  The number of authorized shares under Tesla’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (as described in Tesla’s SEC’s filings) shall be increased by the total number of Returned Options upon cancelation of the Returned Options.\nFor purposes of determining the amount of Returned Cash, each Settlement Option shall be converted to an amount of Returned Cash by calculating the difference between the Settlement Stock Price and the Total Weighted Average Strike Price, as defined in Section 1.28 of the Stipulation (approximately $235.9114, rounded to four decimals).  For illustrative purposes only, to provide 1,000 Settlement Options in Returned Cash, a Director Defendant would pay $235,911 (rounded) (i.e., 1,000 x $235.9114).\nFor purposes of determining the amount of Returned Stock, each Settlement Option shall be converted to a number of Returned Shares by calculating the difference between the Settlement Stock Price and the Total Weighted Average Strike Price, divided by the Settlement Stock Price, regardless of the price of Tesla common stock on the Effective Date.  For illustrative purposes only, to provide 1,000 Settlement Options in Returned Stock, a Director Defendant would return 906 Tesla shares (rounded up) (i.e., 1,000 x $235.9114 ($235,911) / $260.54). The value of each share of Returned Stock shall be the Settlement Stock Price, i.e. $260.54, regardless of the price of Tesla common stock on the Effective Date.\n-\n8\n-\nUsing the valuation methods set forth in the Stipulation, Director Defendants shall deliver to Tesla the value of the Settlement Options, which is equal to $735,266,505 (seven hundred thirty-five million, two hundred sixty-six thousand, five hundred five U.S. Dollars) (“Settlement Option Amount”).  The Settlement Option Amount consists of (i) $458,649,785 in Returned Options, using the valuation method for Returned Options set forth in Section 2.3 of the Stipulation, and (ii) $276,616,720 in Returned Cash and/or Returned Stock, combined, using the valuation methods for Returned Cash and Returned Stock set forth in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, respectively, of the Stipulation.  In the event that Director Defendants return a different combination of (i) Returned Options and (ii) Returned Cash and/or Returned Stock than what is reflected in Section 2.6 of the Stipulation, such adjustment shall not decrease the Settlement Option Amount, and Director Defendants shall inform the Court of any such adjustments no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Settlement Hearing.\nDirector Defendants, jointly and severally, shall cause the Settlement Option Amount (using the valuation methods set forth in Section 2 of the Stipulation) to be provided to Tesla within fifteen (15) Business Days after entry of the Final Judgment.  The Settlement Option Amount shall be applied in the manner set forth in Section 7 of the Stipulation.\nDirector Defendants shall forego permanently the 2021 and 2022 Foregone Options (to the extent Director Defendants served on the Tesla Board during such period) and shall not hereafter receive any compensation for Tesla Board service for 2021 or 2022.  The Current Director Defendants shall also forego permanently any compensation for Tesla Board service for 2023.\nTesla and the Tesla Board (including, as applicable, Current Director Defendants and Other Tesla Directors) shall implement and maintain in substance the following measures during the Settlement Governance Period (defined in Section 1.24 of the Stipulation as the period from the Effective Date until five (5) years after the Effective Date):\n•\nAs soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the Compensation Committee of the Tesla Board (“Compensation Committee”) shall amend its charter to provide that the Compensation Committee shall be responsible for:\n(a)\nconducting annually a review and assessment of all compensation, including cash and equity-based compensation, paid by Tesla to Non-Employee Directors;\n-\n9\n-\n(b)\nengaging an independent compensation consultant (“Independent Consultant”) annually to advise the Compensation Committee in connection with such annual review and assessment, including with respect to (i) the amount and type of Non-Employee Director compensation, and (ii) any comparative data deemed appropriate by such consultant; and\n(c)\nrecommending to the Tesla Board, on the basis of such annual review and assessment, the amount and type of compensation payable to Non-Employee Directors.\n•\nThe Tesla Board (including, as applicable, Current Director Defendants and Other Tesla Directors) shall review annually all compensation payable to Non-Employee Directors, including the recommendation by the Compensation Committee as to such compensation.\n•\nOn an annual basis, Tesla shall submit the proposed annual compensation to be paid to Non-Employee Directors to an approval vote of the majority of Unaffiliated Tesla Stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such decision.  For purposes of the Stipulation, “Unaffiliated Tesla Stockholders” means all Tesla stockholders of record other than (i) Defendants and (ii) Other Tesla Directors (but only while such Other Tesla Directors serve on the Tesla Board).  For the avoidance of doubt, Defendants and Other Tesla Directors (but only while such Other Tesla Directors serve on the Tesla Board) shall (with respect to any and all shares over which they hold beneficial ownership, as that term is defined in 17 CFR § 240.13d-3(a)) abstain from voting in their capacity as stockholders on the votes required by this Section and shall not be counted as shares present or entitled to vote for purposes of determining the majority.\n•\nPrior to any stockholder vote on compensation to be paid to Non-Employee Directors, Tesla shall disclose to stockholders in a proxy at least the following information, in a manner consistent with Tesla’s operative bylaws:\n(a)\na description of the philosophy relating to Non-Employee Director compensation;\n-\n10\n-\n(b)\nthe process by which decisions were made concerning Non-Employee Director compensation, including with respect to the role and analysis of the Independent Consultant and any peer group or other comparative data deemed appropriate by such Independent Consultant (or that no such data was deemed appropriate); and\n(c)\nthe proposed compensation of Non-Employee Directors, including the cash and equity value of such compensation, on a director-by-director basis.\n•\nAs soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Tesla shall review its internal controls specific to Non-Employee Director compensation and implement any changes necessary to continue to ensure appropriate administration of Non-Employee Director compensation.  On an annual basis, Tesla shall continue to review its internal controls specific to Non-Employee Director compensation and continue to report the results of that review to the Audit Committee of the Tesla Board (“Audit Committee”) and the Audit Committee minutes shall reflect that such report was provided.\nThis Action was brought as a derivative action on behalf of and for the benefit of Tesla and its stockholders.  Tesla stockholders will not receive a direct payment of the Settlement Amount but will indirectly benefit from the Settlement Amount being paid to Tesla.\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED?\nWHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE?\nIf the Settlement is approved, the Court will enter the Final Judgment, at which time the Action against Settling Defendants shall be dismissed with prejudice.  The foregoing dismissal is without fees or costs, except as expressly provided in the Stipulation.\nUpon the Effective Date, Plaintiff and Tesla and, as applicable, its stockholders (excluding Defendants), and their respective past, present, or future family members, spouses, heirs, trusts, trustees, executors, estates, administrators, beneficiaries, distributees, foundations, agents, employees, fiduciaries, partners, partnerships, general or limited partners or partnerships, joint ventures, limited\n-\n11\n-\nliability companies, corporations, predecessors, predecessors-in-interest, successors, successors-in-interest, assigns, financial or investment advisors, advisors, consultants, investment bankers, entities providing any fairness opinion, underwriters, brokers, dealers, financing sources, lenders, commercial bankers, attorneys, personal or legal representatives, accountants, associates, and insurers, coinsurers, and re-insurers shall thereupon be deemed to have fully, finally, and forever released, settled, and discharged Released Settling Defendant Parties from and with respect to every one of Released Plaintiff Parties’ Claims, and shall thereupon be forever barred and enjoined from commencing, instituting, prosecuting, or continuing to prosecute any Released Plaintiff Parties’ Claims against any Released Settling Defendant Parties.\nUpon the Effective Date, Settling Defendants and, as applicable, their respective past, present, or future family members, spouses, heirs, trusts, trustees, executors, estates, administrators, beneficiaries, distributees, foundations, agents, employees, fiduciaries, partners, partnerships, general or limited partners or partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies, corporations, predecessors, predecessors-in-interest, successors, successors-in-interest, assigns, financial or investment advisors, advisors, consultants, investment bankers, entities providing any fairness opinion, underwriters, brokers, dealers, financing sources, lenders, commercial bankers, attorneys, personal or legal representatives, accountants, associates, and insurers, coinsurers, and re-insurers shall thereupon be deemed to have fully, finally, and forever released, settled, and discharged Released Plaintiff Parties and Tesla and its stockholders (excluding Defendants) from and with respect to every one of Released Settling Defendant Parties’ Claims, and shall thereupon be forever barred and enjoined from commencing, instituting, prosecuting, or continuing to prosecute any Released Settling Defendant Parties’ Claims against any Released Plaintiff Parties or Tesla and its stockholders (excluding Defendants).\nThe contemplated releases given by Settling Parties in the Stipulation extend to Released Claims that Settling Parties did not know or suspect to exist at the time of the release, which if known, might have affected the decision to enter into this Settlement.\nWith respect to any and all Released Claims, Settling Parties shall be deemed to have waived any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of the United States, any law of any state, or principle of common law which governs or limits a person’s release of unknown claims to the fullest extent permitted by law, and to have relinquished, to the full extent permitted by law, the provisions, rights, and benefits of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (or any similar, comparable\n-\n12\n-\nor equivalent provision of any law of any state or territory of the United States, federal law, or principle of common law), which provides:\nA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.\nSettling Parties and Current Stockholders shall be deemed by operation of law to have acknowledged that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of the Settlement.\nSettling Parties acknowledge that they may discover facts in addition to or different from those that they now know or believe to be true with respect to the Released Claims, but that it is their intention to fully, finally, and forever settle any and all such Released Claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such additional or different facts, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nWHAT ARE THE PARTIES’ REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT?\nThe Settlement set forth in the Stipulation reflects the results of Settling Parties’ negotiations and the final terms of their agreement, which was reached only after arm’s-length negotiations among Settling Parties, who were all represented by counsel with extensive experience and expertise in derivative litigation.\nThis Settlement is not evidence of the validity or invalidity of any claims or defenses in the Action or any other actions or proceedings, or of any wrongdoing by any of Settling Defendants or of any damages or injury to Plaintiff and Tesla and its stockholders.\nPlaintiff believes that the Released Plaintiff Parties’ Claims had merit when filed and continue to have merit, and Plaintiff is settling the Plaintiff’s Claims because it believes that the Settlement will provide substantial value to Tesla and its stockholders.  Plaintiff has concluded that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of Tesla and its stockholders, and that it is reasonable to pursue the Settlement based on the terms and procedures outlined herein.\n-\n13\n-\nSettling Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability, or damage with respect to all claims asserted or that could be asserted in the Action or any other action, in any court or tribunal, relating to the Relevant Period Director Compensation, including any allegations that Settling Defendants have committed any violations of law, that they have acted improperly in any way, and that they have any liability or owe any damages of any kind to Plaintiff and Tesla and its stockholders.  Settling Defendants maintain that their conduct was at all times proper and in compliance with applicable law, and that if the case proceeded to trial and a decision were issued by the Court, they would have prevailed on all claims asserted against them.  Settling Defendants further deny any breach of fiduciary duties to harm Tesla and its stockholders.  Each of the Settling Defendants asserts that, at all relevant times, he or she acted in good faith.  Settling Defendants are entering into the Settlement in order to, among other things, terminate all claims that were or could have been asserted by Plaintiff, Tesla or any other Tesla stockholder against Settling Defendants in the Action or in any other action, in any court or tribunal, relating to the Relevant Period Director Compensation.\nHOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID?\nPlaintiff’s Counsel will submit a Fee and Expense Application to the Court.  Settling Parties acknowledge and agree that any Fee and Expense Award in connection with the Settlement shall be paid by Tesla out of the Settlement Option Amount, as set forth in Section 7 of the Stipulation, and shall reduce the settlement consideration paid to Tesla accordingly.\nWHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SETTLEMENT HEARING BE HELD?  DO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAR AT THE SETTLEMENT HEARING?\nThe Court will consider the Settlement and all matters related to the Settlement, including the Fee and Expense Application, at the Settlement Hearing.  The Settlement Hearing will be held before The Honorable Kathaleen St. J. McCormick on October 13, 2023, at 1:30 pm ET in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, Leonard L.

We are excited that we were able to achieve such results given the macroeconomic environment we are currently in. Our operating margin remained healthy at approximately 10%, even with price reductions in Q1 and early Q2. This reflects our ongoing cost reduction efforts, the continued production ramp success in Berlin and Texas and the strong performance of our Energy and Services & Other businesses. Our commitment to being at the forefront of AI development entered a new chapter with the start of production of Dojo training computers. We are hopeful that our immense neural net training needs will be satisfied using our in-house designed Dojo hardware. The better the neural net training capacity, the greater the opportunity for our Autopilot team to iterate on new solutions. In conclusion, we are focusing on cost reduction, new product development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow. The challenges of these uncertain times are not over, but we believe we have the right ingredients for the long-term success of the business through a variety of high potential projects.

Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light-duty vehicles only TTM = Trailing twelve months In Q2, we produced a record number of vehicles, thanks to ongoing ramps of our new factories as well as strong performance of Shanghai and Fremont. We remain committed to smoothing deliveries throughout the quarter by reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the 3rd month. Vehicles in-transit, test-drive and display vehicles account for a substantive majority of our total days of supply. US: California, Nevada and Texas At Gigafactory Texas, in addition to the continued success of the Model Y ramp, we are also working on equipment installation for Cybertruck production, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We have made notable progress on yield improvement of our 4680 cell production lines. We continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. China: Shanghai Since our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several months, we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Gigafactory Shanghai remains our main export hub. Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg Our factory in Germany produced standard range Model Y vehicles in Q2 for the first time. Building off momentum from its success in Q1, Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of May).\nC O R E   T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta (millions) Internal projection of Dojo compute power Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware Four main technology pillars are needed to solve vehicle autonomy at scale: extremely large real-world dataset, neural net training, vehicle hardware and vehicle software. We are developing each of these pillars in-house. This month, we are taking a step towards faster and cheaper neural net training with the start of production of our Dojo training computer. Vehicle and Other Software For customers getting a Model 3 or Y for the first time, we launched the “Get To Know Your Tesla” experience where users can adjust their seats, mirrors, steering wheel, set up the phone key and learn about topics such as regenerative braking. To help customers discover ongoing improvements in software updates, we now highlight new features directly in the UI, encourage users to try features they may have missed and added the ability to search Controls. Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing We are now testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for final certification and validation. This might be the most unique vehicle product in decades; with that comes trialing and testing new technologies. As far as we know, Cybertruck will be the first sub-19 ft. truck (fitting into a garage) that has both four doors and 6+ ft. bed. Both technologically and architecturally, this vehicle will break a lot of boundaries – very much in line with how we think about vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Source: Tesla estimates\nO T H E R   H I G H L I G H T S Services & Other gross margin Energy Storage deployments (GWh) Energy Storage Energy storage deployments increased by 222% YoY in Q2 to 3.7 GWh, another strong quarter due to the ongoing ramp of our first dedicated Megapack factory (Megafactory) in Lathrop, CA. The ramp of this 40 GWh Megafactory – the first of many - has been successful with still more room to reach full capacity. While energy storage deployment rate can be volatile due to project timing, production rate improved further sequentially in Q2. Solar Solar deployments remained roughly flat sequentially at 66 MW, declining YoY, predominantly due to a high interest rate environment that is causing postponement of solar purchasing industry-wide. Services and Other business The 2nd quarter of 2023 has been the quarter of Supercharging. A significant number of companies, including Ford, GM, Mercedes, Nissan, Polestar, Rivian, Volvo and Electrify America, have announced adoption of NACS – a charging standard developed by Tesla over a decade ago – for their North American products. Further opening our charging network in 2024 will enable both faster market conversion from combustion vehicles to EVs as well as faster growth of our charging network through a larger addressable fleet.\nO U T L O O K Volume We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year. Cash We have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Product Cybertruck remains on track to begin initial production later this year at Gigafactory Texas. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.\nP H O T O S   &   C H A R T S\nC Y B E R T R U C K   T E S T I N G\nC Y B E R T R U C K  -  B U I L T   T O   D O   R E A L   W O R K\nC Y B E R T R U C K  -  P R O D U C T I O N   L I N E   A T   G I G A F A C T O R Y   T E X A S\nC Y B E R T R U C K  -  P R O D U C T I O N   L I N E   A T   G I G A F A C T O R Y   T E X A S   B U I L D I N G   R C   U N I T S\nC Y B E R T R U C K  -  T H E   F I R S T   R C   U N I T\nVehicle Deliveries (millions of units) K E Y   M E T R I C S   Q U A R T E R L Y (Unaudited) Operating Cash Flow ($B) Free Cash Flow ($B) Net Income ($B) Adjusted EBITDA ($B)\nOperating Cash Flow ($B) Free Cash Flow ($B) K E Y   M E T R I C S   T R A I L I N G   1 2   M O N T H S   ( T T M ) (Unaudited) Net Income ($B) Adjusted EBITDA ($B) Vehicle Deliveries (millions of units)\nK E Y   M E T R I C S   T R A I L I N G   1 2   M O N T H S   ( T T M ) (Unaudited) YoY Revenue Growth Operating Margin Source: OEM financial disclosures, Bloomberg Auto Industry includes: Tesla, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota and VW.

beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on July 19, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.   CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network, our energy storage and solar products and our financing products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "492c54be1af42ace06e444108efbeb02c9946b17e71034739d93058dfefe5b95"}

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\nCERTAIN TERMS\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production capacity, efficiency and output rates, supply chain, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, our next generation vehicle platform, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  28", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "94e83e7f21aa18668df4303996fe0842e1c280b0e5fac4093dd3a521979db238"}

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\nCERTAIN TERMS\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP automotive gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production capacity and output rates, supply chain, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, our next generation vehicle platform, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at the California Factory, Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, Gigafactory Texas and Megapack factory are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai; our ability to ramp Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 24, 2022. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  34", "sublinks": [{"url": "https://www.tesla.com/vehiclesafetyreport", "extracted_text": null, "fetch_status": "extract_failed", "similarity_to_main": 0.0}], "content_hash": "e8ae8a1098fabee9effc87e7a4c77cadff160c333d358aae3df720ecef1695a4"}

Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results.

The service he built with his co-founders transformed the hospitality industry, allowing travelers seeking local experiences to book homes in nearly every country around the world. Since the 2007 inception in his San Francisco living room, Airbnb has enabled mutual trust for over 4M hosts to share their homes. Hosts have since welcomed more than 1B guest arrivals and earned over $150B, creating economic impact worldwide. As the original designer and host, Gebbia helped shape Airbnb’s product, interface, and brand to become a household name. His entrepreneurial instinct also led to the formation of their community-powered non-profit, Airbnb.org. With the mission to open homes in times of crisis, their emergency response efforts have housed over 200,000 people during natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global refugee crisis.\nMost recently, Gebbia departed his full-time operating position and transitioned to an advisor role while serving on the Board of Directors of both Airbnb and Airbnb.org. He's begun working on his next startup, acquired a minority stake in the San Antonio Spurs, gives back via his commitment to the Giving Pledge, and serves on other boards and councils such as his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Olympic Refuge Foundation, UNHCR, Tent.org, Malala Fund, and the Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity.", "sublinks": [], "content_hash": "bb2de59bb18a70efce7f9268c2a2896e0139c2c4b5f8ec575a19fc1944170533"}

Gaming revenue was $2.04 billion, down 44% sequentially and down 33% from the prior year. Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.\nThe shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition to reducing sell-in, the company implemented pricing programs with channel partners to reflect challenging market conditions that are expected to persist into the third quarter.\nData Center revenue, though a record, was somewhat short of the company’s expectations, as it was impacted by supply chain disruptions.\nSecond quarter results are expected to include approximately $1.32 billion of charges, primarily for inventory and related reserves, based on revised expectations of future demand.\n“Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory.\n“NVIDIA has excellent products and position driving large and growing markets. As we navigate these challenges, we remain focused on the once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent computing for the era of AI,” he said.\n“The significant charges incurred in the quarter reflect previous long-term purchase commitments we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty,” said Colette Kress, EVP and CFO of NVIDIA.\n“We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. We plan to continue stock buybacks as we foresee strong cash generation and future growth,” she said.\nQ2 FY23 Outlook\n1\nQ2 FY23 Preliminary Results\nRevenue\n$8.10 billion, plus or minus 2%\n$6.70 billion\nGross margin - GAAP\nGross margin - non-GAAP\n65.1%, plus or minus 50 bps\n67.1%, plus or minus 50 bps\n43.7%, plus or minus 50 bps\n46.1%, plus or minus 50 bps\nOperating expenses - GAAP\nOperating expenses - non-GAAP\n$2.46 billion\n$1.75 billion\n$2.42 billion\n$1.75 billion\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense\n$40 million expense\n$24 million and $16 million expense, respectively\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rate\n12.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items\n-35% GAAP (benefit) and 2% non-GAAP, including discrete items\n1\nAnnounced in May 2022 in connection with the company’s press release announcing its financial results for first quarter fiscal 2023.\nRevenue by Market Platform\n($ in billions)\nQ2 FY23\nPreliminary Results\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nGaming\n$2.04\nDown 44%\nDown 33%\nData Center\n3.81\nUp 1%\nUp 61%\nProfessional Visualization\n0.50\nDown 20%\nDown 4%\nAutomotive\n0.22\nUp 59%\nUp 45%\nOEM and Other\n0.13\nDown 12%\nDown 66%\nTotal\n$6.70\nDown 19%\nUp 3%\nThe preliminary results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022, are an estimate, based on information available to management as of the date of this release, and are subject to further changes upon completion of the company’s standard quarter and year-end closing procedures. This update does not present all necessary information for an understanding of NVIDIA’s financial condition as of the date of this release, or its results of operations for the second quarter. As NVIDIA completes its quarter-end financial close process and finalizes its financial statements for the quarter, it will be required to make significant judgments in a number of areas. It is possible that NVIDIA may identify items that require it to make adjustments to the preliminary financial information set forth above and those changes could be material. NVIDIA does not intend to update such financial information prior to release of its final second quarter financial statement information, which is currently scheduled for Aug. 24, 2022.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nNVIDIA will host a conference call on Wednesday, Aug. 24, at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET), to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nThe call will be webcast live (in listen-only mode) on investor.nvidia.com. The company’s prepared remarks will be followed by a question-and-answer session, which will be limited to questions from financial analysts and institutional investors.\nAhead of the call, NVIDIA will provide written commentary on its second-quarter results from its CFO, Colette Kress. This material will be posted to investor.nvidia.com immediately after the company’s results are publicly announced at approximately 1:20 p.m. PT.\nThe webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company’s conference call to discuss financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, this press release includes preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, and income tax expense.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, gains or losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.\nA preliminary updated reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses and tax rate is as follows:\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures\n($ in millions)\nQ2 FY23\nPreliminary Results\nGAAP gross margin\n43.7%\nStock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, and other costs\n2.4\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n46.1%\nGAAP operating expenses\n$2,416\nStock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs\n(667)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n$1,749\nGAAP other expense, net\n$24\nLosses from non-affiliated investments and other costs\n(8)\nNon-GAAP other expense, net\n$16\nGAAP tax rate (benefit)\n(35%)\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments\n37\nNon-GAAP tax rate\n2%\nNVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nAbout NVIDIA\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI.

This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $159.0 billion and $164.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with second quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $13.0 billion and $17.5 billion, compared with $14.7 billion in second quarter 2024.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

By segment, North America revenue increased 10% YoY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% YoY from $131B to $143B, and AWS revenue increased 19% YoY, from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS revenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon’s total revenue was $89B.\nAmazon’s operating income in 2024 improved 86% YoY, from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to $68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.\nApart from the financial results, we made our customers’ lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores business, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm, Profitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the second year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new infrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including our latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and significant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (“GenAI”) services Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows, including new seasons for\nFallout, Reacher, The Boys,\nand\nThe Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power\n, movies like\nRoad House, The Idea of You,\nand\nRed One\n, live sports like\nThursday Night Football\nand\nUEFA Champions League\nin Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple TV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color version, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest Kindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price transparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.\nThese accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention, hard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I’m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this past year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won’t be visible for the next few years).\nA Why Culture\nEvery year in my annual letter, I try to share insight into what makes Amazon tick. At the highest level, we’re aiming to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, making customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it’s actually quite hard, especially with the rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies alike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything around us.\nWe’ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way door decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where you were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. You can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-way door decision is one where it’s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if you get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs assume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed bolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we’ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors has been a simple question: “Why?”\n​\n​\n​\n​\n“Why does this customer experience have to be this way?” “Why can’t it be better?” “What are the constraints—\n​\nwhy must we accept them?” “Why can’t we invent around that?” “Why will it take so long to get to customers?” Why?\nMy Dad has told me that I was the kind of kid who kept asking why, perhaps to an annoying extent. He’s also reminded me how shortly after I joined Amazon in 1997, he tried to persuade me to work somewhere more traditional (and on the east coast closer to family)—only to realize that I’d already found the perfect fit.\nThat’s because Amazon is a Why company. We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct problems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed impenetrable. Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ (let’s call it “YQ”), and it frames the way we think about everything that we do.\nStarting in 1995, we asked why can’t we offer customers every in-print book?\nThen, we asked, why limit ourselves to in-print—why can’t we also offer every out-of-print book?\nWhy not offer every book, ever written, in any language—all available within 60 seconds on a device that’s light and fits in the palm of your hand (Kindle)?\nWhen we offer reviews, why must they all come from professional “experts?” Customers are great resources and will be brutally honest. Why not include customer reviews even if they sometimes dissuade a purchase?\nWhy not offer more than Books? What about Music, Video, Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, Apparel, Home Furnishings?\nWhy not practically everything?\nWhy should we be the only sellers of these items? Millions of third-party merchants and small sellers offer similar or unique items. Why not let customers choose the selection, price, and delivery speed they prefer from among these millions of sellers?\nAfter struggling for a couple years to create awareness for sellers’ selection, we asked ourselves why not show their selection on the same product detail pages as our first-party selection (where all the traffic was)?\nWhy not allow our sellers to also store items in our fulfillment network, enable those items to have fast, Prime delivery, and fulfill those items for sellers (a program called Fulfillment by Amazon)?\nWhy not experiment with relevant advertisements in our store to expose customers to new sellers and items (versus only what our algorithms might surface based on past purchases)?\nWhy does every company need their own capital-intensive datacenters and infrastructure? Why should every development team keep reinventing services like compute, storage, database, and analytics? Why should builders spend 80% of their time on the undifferentiated heavy lifting vs. their unique customer experience? Why not build a set of services (AWS) to solve that for internal and external builders?\nWhy do I have to buy a physical video to watch a movie? Why do I need cable or linear TV to watch amazing TV shows (Prime Video)?\nWhy can’t I get my Prime shipping benefits on other websites than just Amazon (Buy with Prime)?\nI can go on. But, you get the idea. Every one of these Whys have led to significant invention, and every one of them have made customers’ lives better and easier. Some of these seem obvious now. But at the time, these were provocative questions that required curiosity, risk-taking, experimentation, and persistence to make these into success stories.\nEnabling a Why Culture\nIf you believe having high YQ is critical to inventing for customers, how do you enable it? In my opinion, it’s not solved with one mechanism. It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has to be fiercely protected over time if you’re lucky enough to be successful. Here are a few of the strategies we employ.\n​\nCreate leadership principles that set the tone.\nWe have 16 Leadership Principles that guide our behavior. They’re all integral underpinnings to our YQ, but I’ll touch on three in particular:\nAre Right a Lot\n“Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.”\nWhen we first instituted this leadership principle, some people incorrectly assumed it meant that the best leaders were the ones whose ideas were chosen (i.e. they were right, a lot). It led to some people overly digging in and fighting for their ideas. There’s nothing wrong with pushing for what you believe. But, in my experience, the best leaders want to hear others’ views. They don’t wilt or bristle when challenged; they’re intrigued. Effective leaders change their minds when presented with new compelling information (which makes it ironic how people dismiss politicians as “flip-floppers” when they change their position). Ultimately, leaders are responsible for getting to the best answer for customers, regardless of whose original idea is chosen.\nLearn and be Curious\n“Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”\nIn the nearly 28 years I’ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and individuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn. It’s hard to know the reason in each case, but it’s as if some people find it too exhausting, too time-consuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon is the day we risk undermining what we’re capable of building in the future. People with high YQ are always curious how they can get better, become wiser, and incorporate their new knowledge into better customer experiences.\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n“Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”\nWe don’t just empower people to challenge one another, we obligate them to do so if they disagree. Questioning, asking the hard questions, forcing the discussion (versus silently thinking a mistake is being made) is necessary to getting to better answers for customers. “I told you so” has no currency at Amazon. It’s also important to focus on the second part of this leadership principle:\ndisagree and commit\n. While constructive debate is useful; at some point, teams need to make a decision and take action. From that point on, everybody—even those who advocated for a different solution than the one chosen—must commit to making that decision a success. That means the team goes all in—no pocket-vetoing nor hedging between other options. That’s the only way we can preserve speed and confidence that if an issue is heavily debated, the team will ultimately pull together.\nCreate norms that support the Why.\nSimilar to how our Leadership Principles guide our behavior, we’ve built norms over the years that guide how we work. Here are a few examples:\nNarratives\n. We stopped presenting information to each other inside the company via powerpoint in 2004. Given how high level powerpoints are, we found that powerpoint was easy for the presenter to prepare, but harder for the audience to understand the substantive issues. Instead, we moved to writing narratives with a maximum of six pages in the body. Narratives are harder for the presenter (it’s hard to write a thoughtful six-page document that highlights the key issues in enough detail to be crisp and clear), but much easier for the audience to engage with and ask the right Why questions.\nWorking backwards documents\n. When we build services or features, before we start coding, we write Press Release and Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQ”) documents. The Press Release is intended to ensure that what we’re proposing building is remarkable to customers (so we don’t get to launch and ask “wait, why did we think customers would find this interesting?”). And, the FAQ is designed to force ourselves to ask the\n​\n​\n​\n​\nhard questions about which customers will use this capability, what they’ll like most, what they’ll be most disappointed with, why are we drawing the launch line where we are, why is it better than current alternatives, how should we think about pricing, what pricing dimensions we recommend, and why have we made the architectural decisions we have. The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and how we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.\nBe together whenever possible\n. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally, a lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it’s not how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then a group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we’ve found that this process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and some cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn’t compare to being in the same room. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way ideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room—and yields better outcomes for our customers and teams. With what’s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood that every customer experience we’ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important time, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.\nTolerating messy meetings\n. It’s hard to “schedule” innovation. You can’t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon Prime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or Project Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can’t change what’s possible for customers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before getting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we’re inventing, we accept the process being beautifully imperfect.\nOperate like a startup (in our case, the world’s largest startup).\nWe strive to operate like the world’s largest startup. What does that mean?\nFirst, whatever we’re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or meaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because they’re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what’s possible for customers.\nSecond, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They’re people constantly dissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can’t be better. They’re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they’ve previously built), and never feel like the job is done.\nThird, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we’ve hired really smart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our teammates are constantly asking themselves, “What would I do if this was my own money?” “What would I do if I started this company and I was the majority owner?” “Hey, I know I’ve only been asked to own a part of this project, but I’m not sure if the other parts are being driven well—should I stick my nose into this and make sure or just trust somebody’s got it?” Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the quality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company’s mission as their mission (we want missionaries, not mercenaries). That’s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors versus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they own the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable for solving the Whys of their customer experiences.\nFourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It’s a false binary to argue that you can move fast\nor\ndeliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still be high quality. We’ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision. The leadership team has to believe it’s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural barriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company and culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in which we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market segments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking\n​\n​\n​\n​\nfor something better. We spend a lot of time identifying how to unlock these experiences for them as quickly as possible, and know if we don’t, somebody else will.\nAnother way to gain speed is to eliminate bureaucracy. There is a difference between process and bureaucracy. When you’re running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant improvement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get layered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy examples that they were experiencing. I’ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one. Builders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do. As leaders, we don’t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure as heck eliminate it when we do. We’ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to move fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.\nFifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got started. We built Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with 13 people; Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate large teams. Historically, we’ve had periods where we’ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it’s not the way we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our best leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride themselves on being lean.\nSixth, you have to be willing to take risks. This sounds easier than it is. You need clever enough people to identify worthwhile bets. And if you have these inventive, ambitious builders with high standards, they’re not used to failure. They suspect external (and maybe internal) ridicule awaits them if they try something very different that doesn’t work out. So, people often play it safe. But, you can’t achieve something extraordinary for customers by playing “not to lose.” If your Whys take you down an invention path that delivers an experience that doesn’t look like what’s been done before, let customer obsession be your compass. You rarely, if ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everybody else.\nAnd finally, you have to care most about delivering compelling results for customers. It’s not how charismatic you are. It’s not whether you’re really good at managing up or sideways. What matters is what we actually get done for customers. That’s what we want to reward.\nNext generation Whys\nWhile the team and I feel quite optimistic about the progress and potential of our existing businesses, we have plenty of new Whys we’re asking. Below are a few of them and some quick thoughts.\nWhy is AI so important? Will it really have as much impact as some claim and when?\nGenerative AI is going to reinvent virtually every customer experience we know, and enable altogether new ones about which we’ve only fantasized. The early AI workloads being deployed focus on productivity and cost avoidance (e.g. customer service, business process orchestration, workflow, translation, etc.). This is saving companies a lot of money. Increasingly, you’ll see AI change the norms in coding, search, shopping, personal assistants, primary care, cancer and drug research, biology, robotics, space, financial services, neighborhood networks—everything. Some of these areas are already seeing rapid progress; others are still in their infancy. But, if your customer experiences aren’t planning to leverage these intelligent models, their ability to query giant corpuses of data and quickly find your needle in the haystack, their ability to keep getting smarter with more feedback and data, and their future agentic capabilities, you will not be competitive. How soon? It won’t all happen in a year or two, but, it won’t take ten either. It’s moving faster than almost anything technology has ever seen.\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOK, I buy AI is big; but why invest this much this quickly?\nFundamentally, if your mission is to make customers’ lives better and easier every day, and you believe every customer experience will be reinvented by AI, you’re going to invest deeply and broadly in AI. That’s why there are more than 1,000 GenAI applications being built across Amazon, aiming to meaningfully change customer experiences in shopping, coding, personal assistants, streaming video and music, advertising, healthcare, reading, and home devices, to name a few. It’s also why AWS is quickly developing the key primitives (or building blocks) for AI development, such as custom silicon AI chips in Amazon Trainium to provide better price-performance on training and inference, highly flexible model-building and inference services in Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, our own frontier models in Amazon Nova to provide lower cost and latency for customers’ applications, and agent creation and management capabilities.\nThere is also substantial capital investment required. In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more datacenters, chips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We spend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years (in the case of datacenters, for at least 15-20 years). We only start monetizing this capital investment many months after we spend the capital, and over many years—which leads to attractive long-term FCF and ROIC (as people have seen in AWS over the last several years). But in periods, like now, of unusually high demand (our AI revenue is growing at triple digit YoY percentages and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate), you’re deploying a lot of capital. We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we know, the demand is unlike anything we’ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will be well-served by our investing aggressively now.\nWhy do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?\nAI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won’t be in the future. Chips are the biggest culprit. Most AI to date has been built on one chip provider. It’s pricey. Trainium should help, as our new Trainium2 chips offer 30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally available today. While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference (which are the predictions or outputs of the models) will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI cost because customers train their models periodically, but produce inferences constantly in large-scale AI applications. Inference will become another building block service, along with compute, storage, database, and others. We feel strong urgency to make inference less expensive for customers. More price-performant chips will help. But, inference will also get meaningfully more efficient in the next couple of years with improvements in model distillation, prompt caching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures. Reducing the cost per unit in AI will unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire, and also lead to more overall AI spending. It’s like what happened with AWS. Revolutionizing the cost of compute and storage happily led to lower cost per unit, and more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute infrastructure spend.\nWhy have personal assistants not yet taken off? How can Alexa help?\nA great personal assistant can answer virtually any question\nand\nget things done on your behalf. There have been no digital solutions that can do both yet. That is, until Alexa+ arrived. Alexa+ is not only comparably intelligent to the leading chatbots, but can take a plethora of real actions for you. She can play music, play video, move media from one of your devices to another, set alarms and timers, control your smart home, order across hundreds of millions of ecommerce items, make reservations for restaurants or Ubers, order concert tickets, alert you when your favorite artist announces a tour, find a plumber to fix your sink, and memorize whatever you’ve done on Amazon. This is pretty game-changing for consumers, and just the start of what Alexa+ will do. We have over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expect Alexa+ to play an even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\nWhy can’t we get items to customers even faster? Does it matter?\nEvery year, people ask whether we’ve reached the law of diminishing returns on speed of delivery. Our data shows this not to be the case. When we promise faster delivery times, customers complete purchases at a meaningfully higher rate and shop with us more frequently. Amazon Prime started with unlimited, free, two-day delivery for a million products; it’s now grown to over 300 million items, with tens of millions available\n​\nin one day (or better). An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is primarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and the introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we’ve set speed records for two consecutive years, we’re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don’t forget Prime Air, our drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.\nWhy can’t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?\nAs some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we’re going the other way—we’re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We’ve already expanded Same-Day and Overnight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion will provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less densely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in 13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.\nRelated, why can’t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?\nThere are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don’t have access to broadband connectivity. They can’t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access entertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is what Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We’re just launching our first production satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-intensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\nWhy does healthcare have to be so stressful?\nHealthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It’s hard to get fast appointments with primary care physicians, often harder with specialists. There’s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes with patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when they get to the pharmacy, they’re often surprised by the pricing, what’s covered by their insurance, and what you can easily access that’s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It’s why you see such positive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue to iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for One Medical.\nThese are some of the Why questions we’re asking ourselves right now, and I’m excited about the future inventions to come. We’re not going to be bored any time soon.\nWhen I first started working, I thought it was unfathomable that my Dad worked at the same place for 45 years. How could that be? That’s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost 28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.\nAfter all these years, why are you still at Amazon?\nI’m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I’m not sure that any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow through. Second, it’s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world than you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and people. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers and the company. And, I’ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working, and missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of qualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their belly, there’s no better place to be than Amazon.\n​\nWe operate like the world’s largest startup in large part because of our culture of Why. We don’t always get everything right, and we learn and iterate like crazy. But, we’re constantly choosing to prioritize customers, delivery, invention, ownership, speed, scrappiness, curiosity, and building a company that outlasts us all. It remains Day One.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n​\n1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n​\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\nTo our shareholders:\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\nIt’s All About the Long Term\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the\nlong term\n. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n•\nWe will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n​\n​\n•\nWe will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n​\n•\nWhen forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\n​\n•\nWe will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n​\n•\nWe will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n​\n•\nWe will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n​\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.\nObsess Over Customers\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\nto‑search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click\nSM\nshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n•\nSales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\n​\n•\nCumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\n​\n•\nThe percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n​\n•\nIn terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\ntop 20.\n​\n•\nWe established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n​\n​\nInfrastructure\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:\n•\nAmazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.\n​\n•\nDistribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n​\n•\nInventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n​\n•\nOur cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\n​\nOur Employees\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.\nGoals for 1998\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion, or to grow between 5% and 9% compared with first quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or 150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates. Also, as a reminder, in first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately $1.5 billion in net sales.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $14.0 billion and $18.0 billion, compared with $15.3 billion in first quarter 2024.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nFourth Quarter 2024 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with fourth quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in fourth quarter 2023.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n•\nNet sales\nincreased 10% to $148.0 billion in the second quarter, compared with $134.4 billion in second quarter 2023.

compared with an operating loss of $0.9 billion in second quarter 2023.\n•\nAWS segment operating income was $9.3 billion, compared with operating income of $5.4 billion in second quarter 2023.\n•\nNet income\nincreased to $13.5 billion in the second quarter, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 billion, or $0.65 per diluted share, in second quarter 2023.\n•\nSecond quarter

continued reacceleration in AWS growth,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. “As companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers’ top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.”\nSome other highlights since the company’s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\n•\nHeld its 10th Prime Day, the biggest Prime Day shopping event yet.\n•\nDelivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever in the first half of the year.\n•\nExpanded selection, including brands like

aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $154.0 billion and $158.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 11% compared with third quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion, compared with $11.2 billion in third quarter 2023.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

It’s very early days in all of our businesses and we remain excited by how much more we can make customers’ lives better and easier moving forward.”\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:\n•\nContinued to delight customers with fast and convenient delivery. With more than 2 billion global units arriving the same or next day in Q1, Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever.

In Atlanta, AWS Local Zones support EC2 P5 instances, which deliver the highest performance for deep learning and high-performance computing applications.\n•\nAnnounced that AWS began waiving charges for data transfer out to the internet (DTO) to give customers choice if they want to migrate their data outside of AWS. The waiver on DTO charges is available to all AWS customers around the world and from any AWS Region.\nInventing on behalf of customers\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:\n•\nAnnounced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies’ internal data.\n•\nOn the software development side, Amazon Q not only generates highly accurate code, but also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another (today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones; in the near future, Q will help developers transform their .net code as well). Q Developer Agents does multi-step planning and reasoning to allow developers to string together multiple requests and have Q implement them.\n•\nOn the internal data side, most companies have large troves of data that reside in wikis, intranet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and many other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. Customers can point Q at all of its enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with customers about this data. With the launch of a powerful new capability called Q Apps, employees can now describe, in natural language, what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This will make it much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data.\n•\nDelivered a number of innovations in Amazon Bedrock (AWS’s generative AI service that enables customers to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure, high quality, low latency, cost-effective production generative AI apps). Tens of thousands of organizations worldwide are using Amazon Bedrock. These new Bedrock capabilities include:\n•\nThe general availability of Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of vision-enabled foundation models (FMs)—Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku—which are the best performing models in the world right now and provide industry-leading accuracy, performance, speed, and cost. Claude 3 Opus has set a new standard, outperforming other models available today in the areas of reasoning, math, and coding. Amazon Bedrock became the first managed service to add Claude 3 models, and continues to provide customers with the widest choice of high-performing, fully-managed large language models (LLMs) and FMs.\n•\nThe general availability of Meta Llama 3 models, a collection of pretrained and instruction fine-tuned LLMs that come in two sizes—8B and 70B. The new models demonstrate significant improvements over previous versions due to vastly increased training data and scale. This collection of models supports a broad range of use cases, like text summarization and classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and code generation.\n•\nThe addition of FMs from leading AI startup Mistral AI. Mistral Large, the latest and most advanced LLM from Mistral AI, provides top-tier reasoning capabilities for complex multilingual reasoning tasks. Mistral AI’s Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral 7B models can summarize, answer questions, and help organize information with their deep understanding of text structure and architecture.\n•\nThe availability of new Cohere models (Command R and Command R+) on Bedrock.\n•\nNew first party Amazon Titan LLMs, including Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 and the general availability of Amazon Titan Image Generator.\n•\nThe general availability of Model Evaluation, which is the fastest way for organizations to analyze, compare, and select models on Amazon Bedrock, reducing time from weeks to hours spent evaluating models so customers can bring new applications and experiences to market faster.\n•\nThe general availability of Guardrails, which provides customers with best-in-class technology to easily implement safeguards to remove personal and sensitive information, profanity, specific words, and harmful content. Guardrails offers industry-leading safety protection on top of the native capabilities of FMs, helping customers block up to 85% of harmful content. Guardrails is the only solution offered by a broad cloud provider that allows customers to have built-in and custom safeguards in a single offering, and it works with all LLMs in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models.\n•\nThe new Custom Model Import capability that makes it simple for customers to import models from SageMaker (or elsewhere) into Bedrock before deploying their application—enabling customers to take advantage of all the Bedrock features that make it so much easier to build high quality production-grade generative AI apps.\n•\nAnnounced the extension of AWS and NVIDIA’s strategic collaboration to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs, helping customers unlock new generative AI capabilities. AWS will bring together NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell platform with AWS Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service advanced security, Elastic Fabric Adapter petabit-scale networking, and Amazon EC2 UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering, enabling customers to securely build and run multi-trillion parameter LLMs faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2. In addition, Project Ceiba, an AI supercomputer being jointly developed by AWS and NVIDIA exclusively on AWS for NVIDIA’s own AI research and development, will be built on the Blackwell platform.\n•\nContinued to meet growing demand for AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, which help customers maximize performance and control costs for their machine learning (ML) workloads. Customers using these purpose-built AWS ML AI chips include Anthropic, Databricks, Leonardo.ai, Qualtrics, Ricoh, Stockmark, Watashiha, and Vyond. In addition, Meta's recently-launched Llama 3 model is running on Trainium and Inferentia2—delivering the lowest cost to train, fine tune, and deploy Llama 3 on AWS.\n•\nUpdated AWS Neuron (software that lets customers use popular frameworks like PyTorch to train and deploy models with minimal code changes on Amazon EC2 instances, powered by Trainium and Inferentia chips) to include features that further reduce costs for LLM inference for both external customers and internal teams at Amazon, such as Amazon Rufus.\n•\nContinued to rollout Rufus in the Amazon Shopping app to millions of customers in the U.S. Rufus, in beta, is a new generative AI-powered shopping assistant that can help customers save time and make more informed purchase decisions by answering a variety of shopping-related questions, providing product comparisons, making recommendations, and more. Amazon improved Rufus’ answer accuracy and response speed, and added new features, including “My Orders,” which answers questions such as “when did I last order coffee?” and “what dog treats did I last order?”\n•\nAdded more generative AI features for independent sellers in the U.S. to create product listings, including a new tool that allows sellers to leverage product listings on their own websites, simply by providing Amazon with a URL. Amazon’s generative AI-based features automatically parse the information to seamlessly create high-quality, engaging listings for Amazon’s store. This feature further enhances and streamlines the process of creating product listings, saving sellers time and effort, while also developing product listings that appeal to customers and help drive sales.\n•\nReleased 20 films and series from Amazon MGM Studios, including the debut season of\nFallout\n, which attracted more than 65 million viewers worldwide and has become the second most watched title ever on Prime Video through its first 16 days;\nRoad House\n, which attracted more than 50 million viewers worldwide in its first two weekends streaming on Prime Video, the biggest debut ever for an Amazon MGM Studios-produced film;\nHazbin Hotel\n, which had the most total global viewers on its opening weekend for a new animated series on Prime Video; and\nThe Beekeeper\n, which ranked in the top-10 of theatrical releases by revenue globally in the first quarter.\n•\nAnnounced plans to create a new series from MrBeast, the world’s most-subscribed YouTube creator.\nBeast Games\nis set to have 1,000 contestants competing for $5 million—the biggest single prize in the history of television and streaming.

It has supported 263 organizations globally since 2021.\n•\nWas named\nthe largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy by BloombergNEF for the fourth consecutive year. Amazon now has more than 500 wind and solar projects globally that are expected to generate more than 77,000 gigawatt-hours of clean energy each year—or enough to power 7.2 million U.S. homes.\n•\nAnnounced that nearly half of all customer orders fulfilled in India are delivered in reduced or original packaging—meaning less packaging is needed to ensure the deliveries arrive safely, which is better for customers and the environment. Deliveries with reduced or no additional packaging are reaching customers in more than 300 cities across India, up from nine cities in 2019.\n•\nInvested in Glacier, a women-led AI and robotics company that helps the recycling industry reduce waste by automating, sorting, and collecting real-time data on recycling streams. The investment is part of Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, and is the second woman CEO-led company that The Fund has invested in as part of its $53 million Female Founder Initiative, which launched in 2022 to close the funding gap for women in climate tech.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 30, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $144.0 billion and $149.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with second quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from foreign exchange rates. In first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year net sales growth rate.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $10.0 billion and $14.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second quarter 2023.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial\nresults is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“YoY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience.\nWe continue to have the broadest retail selection\n, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\nBeing sharp on price is always important\n, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records\n. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances,\nhelping lower our cost to serve\n. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). More selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond),\nwe’re not done lowering our cost to serve\n. We’ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’s more upside for us.\nInternationally\n, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to\n​\nexpand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\nAlongside our Stores business,\nAmazon’s Advertising progress remains strong\n, growing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and shows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like\nThursday Night Football\n. Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\nShifting to AWS\n, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’re seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why we believe we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\nWe have increasing conviction that\nPrime Video\ncan be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g.\nThursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House\n, etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project\nKuiper\nwhen we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\n​\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue opportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination\n​\nacross Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\n===\nIn my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re thinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us tick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customer obsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world’s biggest start-up.\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’s wrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect. This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building\nprimitive services\n. Think of them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how we described primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible (if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be used together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We won’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize for developer freedom and innovation.”\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re especially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’ve innovated quickly.\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed\n. Let me give you two counter examples that illustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon where we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our warehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower prices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and product detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item management) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have those components. A good set of primitives? Not really.\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decoupling was far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these\n​\necommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build.\nPrimitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate\n.\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to combine them. But,\na good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve\n.\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (“FBA”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we’ll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream\n​\nwarehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom\n. You can keep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the benefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. You’re only constrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience\n. Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these building blocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In the last 10 years, we’ve tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global healthcare problem and opportunity. We’ve now created several important building blocks to help\n​\ntransform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There are dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to the complex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, but which doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reused for other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? You have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?” This, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be even more interesting is\nwhat’s the next set of primitives\nyou’re building that enables breakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI\napplications\n, with the remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\nThe\nbottom\nlayer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The primary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’ve built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production. Getting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built Amazon SageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using SageMaker).\nThe\nmiddle\nlayer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and leverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed\n​\nservice. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale GenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-use capabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to a very strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continues to iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering\nGuardrails\n(to safeguard what questions applications will answer),\nKnowledge Bases\n(to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or RAG—and real-time queries),\nAgents\n(to complete multi-step tasks), and\nFine-Tuning\n(to keep teaching and refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new models from Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world), Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build a production GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don’t want\nonly\none model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is what Bedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP, Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines, Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, Perplexity AI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\nThe\ntop\nlayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS, including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launched Amazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ various data repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answer questions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable work assistant available today and evolving fast.\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize this next seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some of their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track record in the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\n===\nRecently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its wording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answer lies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continually improve and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may be interesting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate; 4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technology that enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—\n​\nactually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloud computing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still\n​\non-premises. These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of millions of people who don’t have adequate broadband access will gain that connectivity in the next few years. Last but certainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass modernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there’s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top of the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.\nThere has never been a time in Amazon’s history where we’ve felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers’ lives better and easier. We’re incredibly excited about what’s possible, focused on inventing the future, and look forward to working together to make it so.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n​\n1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n​\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\nTo our shareholders:\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\nIt’s All About the Long Term\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the\nlong term\n. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n•\nWe will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n​\n​\n•\nWe will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n​\n•\nWhen forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\n​\n•\nWe will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n​\n•\nWe will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n​\n•\nWe will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n​\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.\nObsess Over Customers\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\nto‑search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click\nSM\nshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n•\nSales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\n​\n•\nCumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\n​\n•\nThe percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n​\n•\nIn terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\ntop 20.\n​\n•\nWe established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n​\n​\nInfrastructure\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:\n•\nAmazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.\n​\n•\nDistribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n​\n•\nInventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n​\n•\nOur cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\n​\nOur Employees\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.\nGoals for 1998\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P.

The regionalization of our U.S. fulfillment network led to our fastest-ever delivery speeds for Prime members while also lowering our cost to serve; AWS’s continued long-term focus on customers and feature delivery, coupled with new genAI capabilities like Bedrock, Q, and Trainium have resonated with customers and are starting to be reflected in our overall results; our Advertising services continue to improve and drive positive results; our newer businesses are progressing nicely, and along with our more established businesses, collectively making customers’ lives easier and better every day. As we enter 2024, our teams are delivering at a rapid clip, and we have a lot in front of us to be excited about.”\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:\n•\nHeld a record-breaking Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event. Customers worldwide purchased more than 1 billion items on Amazon and saved nearly 70% more during the 11 days of deals compared to the same period in 2022. In the U.S., customers ordered more than 500 million items from independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, and millions of customers signed up for a Prime membership. Through the entire holiday season, customers purchased more items on Amazon than during any previous holiday season.\n•\nContinued to delight customers with fast and convenient delivery. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas and operates more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. The company increased the number of items delivered through these sites the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and celebrated the delivery of its billionth package from a Same-Day site in December 2023.\n•\nEntered a strategic partnership with Hyundai to bring innovative new experiences to customers. In 2024, Amazon will launch online vehicle sales in the U.S., starting with Hyundai.

Project Kuiper also announced a private connectivity service with AWS, which will allow customers to send data from remote locations directly to the cloud without relying on public internet, as well as a collaboration with Japan’s leading mobile network provider, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, and Asia’s largest satellite operator, SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation.\n•\nHeld the 12th AWS re:Invent conference, which welcomed over 50,000 in-person attendees and more than 300,000 virtually, where AWS announced new technologies and capabilities that help customers of all sizes take advantage of generative AI, improve productivity, and enhance their security posture. These include:\n•\nAmazon Q, the coding companion from AWS. Q is an expert on AWS—it writes code, debugs code, tests code, and does translations, such as moving from an old version of Java to a new one. It can also query AWS customers’ various data repositories (e.g. intranets, wikis, and from over 40 different popular connectors to data stored using Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, or Zendesk) to answer questions, summarize data, carry on a conversation, and take action. Like all AWS services, Q was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant available and keeps getting better.\n•\nExpanded model choice and added new capabilities for Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully-managed service for leveraging existing large language models (LLMs) and customizing them with their own data—all without sacrificing the leading security, reliability, and operational performance that is synonymous with AWS. AWS is continuing to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including Guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, Knowledge Bases to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agents to complete multi-step tasks, and Fine-Tuning to keep teaching and refining models, all to help customers’ applications be higher quality and offer better customer experiences. With Bedrock, AWS offers a choice of high-performing FMs from leading AI companies and added the latest new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and its own Amazon Titan family of FMs, expanding customers’ choice of industry-leading models to support a variety of use cases. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is what Bedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it.\n•\nNew capabilities in Amazon SageMaker to accelerate building, training, and deploying LLMs and other FMs. Amazon SageMaker HyperPod reduces time to train FMs by up to 40% by providing purpose-built\ninfrastructure for distributed training at scale. Amazon SageMaker Inference reduces FM deployment costs by 50% on average and latency by 20% on average by optimizing the use of accelerators.\n•\nThe next generation of AWS chips optimized for the cloud, which deliver advancements in price performance with each successive generation. AWS Graviton4 chips provide up to 30% better compute performance, 50% more cores, and 75% more memory bandwidth than current generation AWS Graviton3 processors for a broad range of customer workloads running in Amazon EC2.\n•\nAWS Trainium2 chips, which are designed to deliver up to four times faster ML training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity compared to first generation AWS Trainium chips.\n•\nAn expanded collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA to deliver the most advanced infrastructure, software, and services to power customers’ generative AI innovations. AWS will be the first cloud provider to bring NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with multi-node NVLink technology to the cloud. NVIDIA and AWS are also collaborating on Project Ceiba to design the world’s fastest GPU-powered AI supercomputer, hosted by AWS for NVIDIA’s own research and development team.\n•\nThe general availability of Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, a first-of-its-kind consumption model that enables customers to reserve the amount of GPU capacity they need for short durations to run their ML workloads, eliminating the need to hold onto GPUs when not in use.\n•\nThe general availability of Amazon S3 Express One Zone, a high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class and the lowest latency cloud object storage available, delivering single-digit millisecond data access for customers’ most latency-sensitive applications, such as ML training and inference, and media content creation.\n•\nFour integrations that enable customers to make data access and analysis faster, without building and managing complex extract, transform, and load (ETL) data pipelines. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift enable customers to analyze data from multiple sources without building and maintaining custom data pipelines. Amazon DynamoDB zero-ETL integration with Amazon OpenSearch Service enables full-text and vector search on operational data in near real time.\n•\nAmazon Aurora Limitless Database, Amazon ElastiCache Serverless, and AI-driven scaling and optimizations for Amazon Redshift Serverless, which make it faster and easier for customers to scale their data infrastructure to support their most demanding use cases. These innovations build on AWS’s serverless technologies to help customers manage data at any scale and simplify their operations, so they can focus on innovating for their end users without spending time and effort provisioning, managing, and scaling their data infrastructure.\n•\nGenerative AI capabilities in Amazon Connect, AWS’s cloud contact center that enables organizations to boost productivity, save costs, and improve customer service experiences, such as Amazon Q in Connect to assist agents with real-time responses and recommended actions to help improve customer satisfaction, and Amazon Connect Contact Lens to add AI-generated summaries from customer conversations.\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners. For example, the company:\n•\nLaunched Sequoia, a new robotics system that allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. Sequoia supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations. From there, employees can lift the totes using their power zone—mid-thigh to mid-chest—reducing how often they have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders.\n•\nIntroduced Automated Vehicle Inspection (AVI), an AI-powered technology that performs a full-vehicle inspection in seconds. The system runs on AWS and can spot anomalies in Amazon delivery vans—from tire deformities and undercarriage wear to bent or warped body pieces—before they become on-road problems. AVI is available in Canada, Germany, the UK, and the U.S.\n•\nAnnounced a £170 million investment in UK hourly employees—increasing the minimum starting pay by £1 per hour and bringing the minimum starting hourly wage for frontline operations employees in the UK to between £12.30 and £13.00 by April 2024. The increase means Amazon’s minimum starting pay in the UK will have increased 20% over two years, and 50% since 2018.\n•\nGave Amazon customers a way to show appreciation for delivery drivers during the holiday season with the “Alexa, Thank My Driver” promotion. Over a two-day period, customers thanked their drivers 2 million times, with drivers receiving $5 per thank you at no cost to the customer.\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and communities. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\n•\nReleased the company’s U.S. Community Impact Report, which shows Amazon has delivered more than 33 million meals directly to underserved families from 2020 to 2023; donated over 88 million pounds of food from 2020 to 2023; provided STEM education, literacy, and career exploration courses to 6,000 schools and 560,000 students during the 2022-2023 academic year; and provided free training in cloud computing and technology to more than 13 million adults in the last year.\n•\nProvided more than 75,000 relief items to communities impacted by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, using Amazon’s global logistics capabilities. AWS also supported nonprofit Help.NGO to build an emergency connectivity network in Mexico to allow first responders to map the impacted area, and offered cloud computing resources to process mapping data collected on-site to assess storm damage.\n•\nAnnounced new renewable energy projects, including Amazon’s first brownfield solar project, which will repurpose a previously polluted Maryland coal mine site into a solar farm; 11 renewable energy projects across Texas; Amazon’s first renewable energy project in South Korea; and a 198-megawatt wind farm in India. In 2023, Amazon added 100 new solar and wind projects.\n•\nAnnounced Amazon’s first U.S. fulfillment center to eliminate plastic delivery packaging and replace it with paper packaging that is curbside recyclable, part of a multi-year plan to convert U.S. fulfillment centers to paper packaging. In addition, Amazon announced that delivery packaging is now fully recyclable in Europe.\n•\nAnnounced that AWS more than doubled the amount of lower-carbon concrete and steel used to build its data centers in 2023 compared to 2022. AWS collaborates with local suppliers to increase the availability of these materials across the construction industry. Emissions released during building materials’ life cycle accounts for around 11% of global carbon emissions.\n•\nPublished the AWS Economic Impact Study, which highlights that AWS invested more than $108 billion in U.S. cloud infrastructure from 2011 through 2022, contributed nearly $38 billion in estimated gross domestic product to the U.S. economy, and supported an estimated annual average of nearly 30,000 jobs in local communities where AWS operates.\n•\nLaunched AI Ready to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people globally by 2025. The program includes eight free AWS-designed AI courses and a new generative AI scholarship program to help more than 50,000 high school and university students from underserved and underrepresented communities gain AI skills.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nFirst Quarter 2024 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 13% compared with first quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $8.0 billion and $12.0 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in first quarter 2023. This guidance includes approximately $0.9 billion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2024.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

Amazon also ranked in the top 10 for the 15th consecutive year on\nthe Axios Harris Poll 100, an annual ranking of the reputation of the most visible companies in America.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of August 3, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2023 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.0 billion, or to grow between 9% and 13% compared with third quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter 2022.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n•\nNet sales\nincreased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022. Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.\n•\nNorth America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.\n•\nInternational segment sales increased 1% year-over-year to $29.1 billion, or increased 9% excluding changes in foreign exchange rates.\n•\nAWS segment sales increased 16% year-over-year to $21.4 billion.\n•\nOperating income\nincreased to $4.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. First quarter 2023 operating income includes approximately $0.5 billion of charges related to estimated severance costs.\n•\nNorth America segment operating income was $0.9 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.6 billion in first quarter 2022.\n•\nInternational segment operating loss was $1.2 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.3 billion in first quarter 2022.\n•\nAWS segment operating income was $5.1 billion, compared with operating income of $6.5 billion in first quarter 2022.\n•\nNet income\nwas $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or $0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.\n•\nFirst quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.\n•\nOperating cash flow\nincreased 38% to $54.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $39.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.\n•\nFree cash flow\nimproved to an outflow of $3.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $18.6 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.\n•\nFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations\nimproved to an outflow of $10.1 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $29.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.\n•\nFree cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations\nimproved to an outflow of $4.5 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $22.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.\n“There’s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023). Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.”\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nContinued to delight customers with convenient delivery options and broad selection. Nearly 26 million customers ordered items with Same-Day Delivery in the quarter, an increase of 50% compared to last year.\n•\nIncreased selection in its U.S. online store with the addition of new marquee beauty, home, and fashion brands, including Lancôme, Shiseido, World of Martha by Martha Stewart, Rent the Runway, KNOW Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, as well as new The Drop collections from Harlem Fashion Row and Coco & Breezy. The Drop offers customers access to limited-edition, made-on-demand clothing collections by fashion influencers.\n•\nLaunched a new Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) capacity management system to help sellers who use Amazon’s storage, packing, and shipping fulfillment service to manage their inventory and capacity more efficiently as they scale their businesses. The management system provides sellers with more insight, predictability, visibility, and control to better plan and manage their inventory and supply chains, as well as increase capacity limits when needed.\n•\nReleased the third annual Brand Protection Report highlighting the company’s efforts to protect customers, brands, and selling partners from counterfeit products in 2022. The efforts resulted in more seized products, criminal referrals, and industry partnerships than ever before. The report demonstrates how Amazon is stopping bad actors and making an impact beyond Amazon’s store, including by identifying, seizing, and appropriately disposing of more than 6 million counterfeit products, preventing them from reaching customers and being resold elsewhere in the global supply chain.\n•\nLaunched Reviews from Amazon, a new capability that enables Buy with Prime merchants to display customer ratings and reviews from Amazon.com within their own online stores at no additional cost. Nearly 20% of Buy with Prime merchants are already using this feature, and the early feedback is that it’s helping merchants drive higher shopper conversion.\n•\nAcquired One Medical, a primary care organization offering both 24/7 virtual care services and in-office visits across the U.S. for preventive and everyday health, chronic care management, pediatric care, and mental health services. For a limited time, One Medical is offering annual memberships to new customers at the discounted price of $144 for the first year (regularly $199/year), the equivalent of $12 per month.\n•\nAnnounced that Prime Video will exclusively present the first-ever “Black Friday” National Football League game on November 24. The game will be available for all fans to stream for free in the U.S. without a Prime membership.\n•\nSet box-office records with MGM’s premiere of\nCreed III\n, directed by and starring Michael B. Jordan. The movie grossed $100.4 million globally in its opening weekend—the best U.S. debut for any sports film in history. It also had the biggest global box office gross of any of the\nCreed\ntitles, at over $250 million to date, and is still opening in territories around the world.

The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nAnnounced new AWS tools that make building with generative artificial intelligence (AI) easy, practical, and cost-effective for organizations of all sizes. The tools include:\n•\nAmazon Bedrock, a new managed service that offers customers the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock provides easy access to leading foundation models (ultra-\nlarge machine learning models that generative AI relies on) from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, and Stability AI, as well as exclusive access to the Titan family of foundation models developed by AWS. Broad access to models gives customers flexibility and choice to customize and scale to their specific needs.\n•\nTwo next-generation compute offerings to deliver the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud: the general availability of instances powered by AWS-designed Inferentia2 chips, AWS’s second-generation accelerator, purpose-built for deep learning inference, as well as the general availability of network-optimized Trn1n instances for large, network-intensive models. Compared to other EC2 instances, Inferentia2 provides up to 40% better inference price performance, and Trainium delivers up to 50% savings on training costs.\n•\nGeneral availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI coding companion that improves developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. Amazon CodeWhisperer is free for individual developers. CodeWhisperer is the most accurate, fastest, and most secure way to generate code for AWS services, including Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3. During a productivity challenge, participants who used CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster (on average) and were 27% more likely to complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer.\n•\nReceived Zoox’s driverless testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, marking a key step to commercializing the self-driving robotaxi for the general public. With this permit, Zoox completed an initial run of its shuttle service for employees at its headquarters in Foster City, California, making it the first purpose-built robotaxi to operate on public roads in California.\n•\nExpanded the Ring lineup with new devices. Ring Battery Doorbell Plus offers improved HD video and energy-saving features, and Ring Peephole Cam is an apartment and renter-friendly video doorbell that easily installs over an existing door peephole.\n•\nExpanded the Amazon-built TV lineup with the Fire TV 2-Series, which makes getting an Alexa-enabled TV more affordable than ever, and new sizes of the Omni QLED Series. The Omni QLED Series includes features so customers can see their schedule on the screen, control smart devices, and turn the TV into an in-home art gallery. Amazon has surpassed 200 million Fire TV devices sold globally. Amazon also launched Amazon-built TVs in Germany, Mexico, and the UK, and collaborated with Cochlear to help people with hearing loss stream sound from their Amazon smart TVs directly to their Cochlear hearing implants.\n•\nUnveiled three customer terminal designs for Project Kuiper, Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative. Kuiper’s mission is to bridge the digital divide by providing fast, affordable broadband to communities worldwide that are unserved or underserved by traditional technologies. To use Kuiper’s broadband, residential and commercial customers will install an outdoor antenna, called a customer terminal, to communicate with satellites overhead. Amazon is preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year and plans to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024.\n•\nOpened Amazon Sidewalk to developer testing for the first time as part of the company’s vision to put a billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the network. Amazon Sidewalk is a low-bandwidth, long-range community network that connects devices across long distances where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals often cannot reach. With Sidewalk coverage extending to 90% of the U.S. population, developers can now build and connect a new range of devices for the network.\n•\nLaunched a loyalty linking capability for Amazon One, Amazon’s palm recognition service that lets customers enter, identify, and pay. Panera is the first restaurant chain to offer the new loyalty linking capability, allowing customers to easily enroll in and redeem rewards, and pay for their purchases with just their palm.\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners. For example, in the first quarter, the company:\n•\nAnnounced plans to spend $200 million on safety technologies across Amazon’s U.S. transportation network in 2023. These innovations include front-collision warning, lane-departure warning, speed limiters, and 360-degree camera detection systems. They are part of Amazon’s work to ensure that vehicles and delivery partners are safe on the road, and the innovations are better for the environment.\n•\nAnnounced that Amazon improved recordable incident rates worldwide by 11% from 2021 to 2022 and by almost 24% from 2019 to 2022. The company shared the data in the second edition of its safety report,\nDelivered With Care\n, which details how Amazon is advancing safety across its operations through investments in capital improvements, safety\ntechnology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and communities.\n•\nReached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.\n•\nRanked No. 2 on\nFortune\nmagazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.\n•\nIntroduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\n•\nActivated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.\n•\nSet a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.\n•\nExpanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.\n•\nAnnounced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.\n•\nAnnounced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).\n•\nLaunched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.\n•\nAnnounced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\nSecond Quarter 2023 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory, and with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top of the unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largest businesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made important adjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we’ll invent moving forward, while still preserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers, shareholders, and employees.\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you operate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (the conditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\nIn the 25 years I’ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we’ve initiated ourselves. When I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did not have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly every physical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts for 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly, building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003 when we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn’t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually every book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight digital reader was not “a thing” yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistant like Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop, and retrieve all sorts of information.\nThere have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us with new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buy inventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritized the long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actually lowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). You saw this sort of balancing again in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis. We took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we also balanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial future businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business. We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voices inside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) would be investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors; and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision to continue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, with strong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to public sector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company if we’d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes a-knocking. But, when you see it’s coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well over a long period of time usually succeed. I’m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way our team is responding to the changes we see in front of us.\n​\nOver the last several months,\nwe took a deep look across the company, business by business\n, invention by invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to us shuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores and 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren’t producing the returns we’d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and amended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision to eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we’ve made over the last several months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluate what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\nWe also looked hard at\nhow we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come back to the office at least three days a week\n, beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that presented themselves. It was impressive and I’m proud of the way our collective team came together to overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don’t think it’s the best long-term approach. We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on one another’s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\nA critical challenge we’ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e. the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—and\nwe’ve made several changes that we believe will meaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery\n.\nDuring the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew at an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant that we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we’d built over the prior 25 years and substantially accelerate building a last-mile transportation network that’s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in the span of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard to make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of optimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we’ve scrutinized every process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and mechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There’s more work to do, but we’re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\nWe also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and faster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was organized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn’t have the product a customer ordered, we’d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing delivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of additional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes (e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard\n​\nwork came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue to improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We’ve recently completed this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve, less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we’re excited about seeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we’re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\nAWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul\n. Despite growing 29% year-over-year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost-optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS.\nWhile these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we’re seeing in AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies use discontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and we find an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring to move to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantly for customers, AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly (over 3,300 new features and services launched in 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what’s possible.\nChip development is a good example. In last year’s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our general-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we delivered our Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machine learning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips most commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for machine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning model provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (“Trainium”); and for the most common machine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at up to 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate to large-scale production, they’ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained periodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised. We launched our first inference chips (“Inferentia”) in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers up to four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With the enormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS’s training and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We’re not close to being done innovating here, and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the early stages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade.\nSimilarly high potential, Amazon’s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands, which is part of why it continues to grow at a brisk clip\n. Akin to physical retailers’ advertising businesses selling shelf space, end-caps, and placement in their circulars, our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part\n​\nof the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade. However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to advertising that’s more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% YoY in Q4 2022, 25% YoY overall for 2022 on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses’ growth have slowed over the last several quarters.\nWe strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities that will help us achieve that mission. We’re continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we’ve invested in building comprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (“AMC”). AMC is a “clean room” (i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this concerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video, live sports, audio, and grocery products. We’ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience, and grow this part of our business.\nWhile it’s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable, long-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can’t stop inventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company.\nWhen we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions:\n◦\nIf we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital?\n​\n◦\nIs the opportunity being well-served today?\n​\n◦\nDo we have a differentiated approach?\n​\n◦\nAnd, do we have competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly?\n​\nIf we like the answers to those questions, then we’ll invest. This process has led to some expansions that seem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed.\nThe earliest example is when we chose to\nexpand from just selling Books\n, to adding categories like Music, Video, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn’t universally applauded, but in retrospect, it seems fairly obvious.\nThe same could be said for our\ninternational Stores expansion\n. In 2022, our international consumer segment drove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we’re big enough to be impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base was remarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% in Japan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we’ve invested in new international geographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, but we like the trajectory they’re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we’ve seen in North America and our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure and services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/\n​\ntelecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliver solutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint will allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generating consumer business.\n​\nBeyond geographic expansion, we’ve been working to expand our customer offerings across some large, unique product retail market segments.\nGrocery\nis an $800B market segment in the US alone, with the average household shopping three to four times per week. Amazon has built a somewhat unusual, but significant grocery business over nearly 20 years. Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the 1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don’t require temperature control such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care, and beauty. However, we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket’s 30K for the same categories. To date, we’ve also focused on larger pack sizes, given the current cost to serve online delivery. While we’re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more of our customers’ grocery needs than we do today. To do so, we need a broader physical store footprint given that most of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural and organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years ago. Today, it’s a large and growing business that continues to raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we’ve continued to invest in the business while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path, but to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth expanding broadly. Amazon Fresh is the brand we’ve been experimenting with for a few years, and we’re working hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale. Grocery is a big growth opportunity for Amazon.\nAmazon Business\nis another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities position us well to pursue this large market segment. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings. While some areas of the economy have struggled over the past few years, Amazon Business has thrived. Why? Because the team has translated what it means to deliver selection, value, and convenience into a business procurement setting, constantly listening to and learning from customers, and innovating on their behalf. Some people have never heard of Amazon Business, but, our business customers love it. Amazon Business launched in 2015 and today drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales. More than six million active customers, including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies, are enjoying Amazon Business’ one-stop shopping, real-time analytics, and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies. We believe that we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible to date, and plan to keep building the features our business customers tell us they need and want.\nWhile many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon’s marketplace, there are also a large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of the challenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented\nBuy with Prime\nto help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products on their own websites to our large Amazon Prime membership, and offer those customers fast, free Prime shipping and seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional benefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and any returns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been made available to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-party shopping sites by 25% on average. Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling these shipments more easily, Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations, and Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web.\nExpanding internationally, pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon, and using our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat natural extensions for us. There are also a few investments we’re making that are further from our core businesses, but where we see unique opportunity. In 2003, AWS would have been a classic example. In 2023, Amazon Healthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues.\nOur initial efforts in\nHealthcare\nbegan with pharmacy, which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce. For years, Amazon customers had asked us when we’d offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrations mounted with current providers. Launched in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy is a full-service, online pharmacy that offers transparent pricing, easy refills, and savings for Prime members. The business is growing quickly, and continues to innovate. An example is Amazon Pharmacy’s recent launch of RxPass, which for a $5 per\n​\nmonth flat fee, enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need for dozens of common conditions, like high blood pressure, acid reflux, and anxiety. However, our customers have continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and unsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it’s a prevalent first stop in the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early Amazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical’s patient-focused experience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business; and in July 2022, we announced our acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It has a fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or video conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US where patients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians in each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so One Medical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believe that One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like for customers.\nKuiper\nis another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there’s high customer need. Our vision for Kuiper is to create a low-Earth orbit satellite system to deliver high-quality broadband internet service to places around the world that don’t currently have it. There are hundreds of millions of households and businesses who don’t have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they’ll be able to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services, starting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governments improving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, but affordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower the barriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing overhead, and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than $400 each. They’re small: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, but they deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. And they’re powered by Amazon-designed baseband chips. We’re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we’ve shared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential opportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it’s capital intensive at the start, but has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue and operating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well as the investment hypothesis to go after it.\nOne final investment area that I’ll mention, that’s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our business for many decades to come, and where we’re investing heavily is\nLarge Language Models (“LLMs”) and Generative AI\n. Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it’s only been the last five to ten years that it’s started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift was driven by several factors, including access to higher volumes of compute capacity at lower prices than was ever available. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everything from personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air, to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning, called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning adoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billions of parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall and learning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we’ve done for years in AWS, we’re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS is offering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose from various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customers are accustomed to using. And, we’re delivering applications like AWS’s CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes\n​\ndeveloper productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter. Let’s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.\nSo, in closing, I’m optimistic that we’ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I’ve mentioned many of them above. But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have a consumer business that’s $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail still resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it’s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have AWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate to the cloud. As these equations steadily flip—as we’re already seeing happen—we believe our leading customer experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years. And, of course, this doesn’t include the other businesses and experiences we’re pursuing at Amazon, all of which are still in their early days.\nI strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at Amazon to make it so.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n​\n1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n​\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\nTo our shareholders:\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\nIt’s All About the Long Term\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the\nlong term\n. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n•\nWe will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n​\n​\n•\nWe will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n​\n•\nWhen forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\n​\n•\nWe will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n​\n•\nWe will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n​\n•\nWe will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n​\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.\nObsess Over Customers\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\nto‑search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click\nSM\nshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n•\nSales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\n​\n•\nCumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\n​\n•\nThe percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n​\n•\nIn terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\ntop 20.\n​\n•\nWe established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n​\n​\nInfrastructure\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:\n•\nAmazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.\n​\n•\nDistribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n​\n•\nInventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n​\n•\nOur cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\n​\nOur Employees\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.\nGoals for 1998\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P.

In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon. The vast majority of total market segment share in both Global Retail and IT still reside in physical stores and on-premises datacenters; and as this equation steadily flips, we believe our leading customer experiences in these areas along with the results of our continued hard work and invention to improve every day, will lead to significant growth in the coming years. When you also factor in our investments and innovation in several other broad customer experiences (e.g. streaming entertainment, customer-first healthcare, broadband satellite connectivity for more communities globally), there’s additional reason to feel optimistic about what the future holds.”\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nHad a record-breaking holiday season with customers purchasing nearly half a billion items from small businesses in the U.S. During Amazon’s biggest Thanksgiving-through-Cyber-Monday holiday shopping weekend ever, customers around the world purchased hundreds of millions of products, and small businesses in the U.S. generated more than $1 billion in sales over the five-day period.\n•\nMade Same-Day Delivery even faster in major metropolitan areas in the U.S., such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Portland, Oregon, where customers can now receive hundreds of thousands of items within hours. Amazon’s new Same-Day Delivery site in Sacramento is set to be the world’s first logistics facility certified as Zero Carbon by the International Living Future Institute. In the EU, Same-Day Delivery is now available in Belgium.\n•\nAttracted more than 100 million viewers worldwide to the first season of\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n, making it the most watched Amazon Original series in every region of the world, with more than 24 billion minutes streamed, and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. Amazon Studios also announced the all-female slate of directors—Charlotte Brändström, Sanaa Hamri, and Louise Hooper—for Season Two of\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n, which is currently in production in the UK.\n•\nFinished the\nThursday Night Football (TNF)\nseason with the youngest median age of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and viewership up 11% from last season among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds, according to Nielsen Media Research.\nTNF\nfeatured the most streamed NFL games ever, with an average audience of 11.3 million viewers, according to combined data from Amazon’s first-party measurement metrics and Nielsen Media Research. Prime Video also made history as the first streamer to place on\nVariety’s\nTop 100 Primetime Telecasts of 2022, with four of its\nTNF\ntelecasts making the list.\n•\nPremiered several Original series and films, including Western drama\nThe English\n, with Emily Blunt;\nfamily-friendly competition show\nDr. Seuss Baking Challenge\n;\nMy Policeman\n,\nstarring Harry Styles;\nand documentary\nGood Night Oppy\n. Prime Video also released new seasons of existing series, including the fourth volume of Rihanna’s annual fashion experience\nSavage X Fenty\nand the third season of\nTom Clancy’s Jack Ryan\n, starring John Krasinski.\nWednesday\n, an MGM-produced series on Netflix, debuted at No. 1 on Nielsen’s weekly streaming charts and earned Golden Globe nominations for Best Musical or Comedy Series and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series (Jenna Ortega).\n•\nBrought HBO back to Prime Video Channels in the U.S., after reaching an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. For $15.99 per month, customers who subscribe to HBO Max have access to approximately 15,000 hours of curated premium content.\n•\nAnnounced new commitments and migrations from AWS customers.\n•\nNasdaq completed the migration of its MRX core trading system to the cloud, delivering a 10% performance improvement for market participants and marking a major milestone in Nasdaq’s journey to deliver the first cloud-based U.S. options exchange.\n•\nNFL and AWS announced the NFL Contact Detection Challenge, which invites experts to use machine learning (ML) and computer vision to predict and prevent injuries.\n•\nYahoo Ad Tech selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to develop tailored and immersive solutions for brands to better connect with their audiences.\n•\nStability AI selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to build and train artificial intelligence (AI) models for the best performance at the lowest cost.\n•\nDescartes Labs is going all-in on AWS to give customers timely, actionable insights to tackle challenges like enhancing food security and mitigating climate change.\n•\nBrookfield Asset Management selected AWS as a preferred cloud provider to advance renewable energy use globally.\n•\nDuke Energy is working with AWS on smart grid solutions to improve reliability and resiliency in preparation for rapid electric vehicle adoption.\n•\nWallbox migrated to AWS, enabling customers to return excess energy to the grid and reducing the company’s IT costs by 70%.\n•\nAmerican Family Insurance named AWS as its preferred cloud provider to unlock personalized service and security for its 13.1 million policyholders.\n•\nLaunched AWS Regions in Spain and Switzerland as well as a second Region in India to continue expanding AWS’s infrastructure footprint, delivering the most secure, extensive, and reliable cloud technology to millions of customers around the world. As of the end of 2022, AWS has 96 Availability Zones within 30 geographic Regions globally, with announced plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions.\n•\nExpanded the AWS Partner Network to help customers accelerate innovation in their organizations and speed their journey to the cloud. Professional services company Accenture launched a platform that helps customers drive business outcomes up to 50% faster on AWS. Atos, a provider of managed infrastructure services, will collaborate with AWS to enable customers with large-scale infrastructure outsourcing contracts to accelerate digital transformation and workload migrations to the cloud. Global business and technology consulting company Slalom will develop vertical solutions and accelerators on AWS for joint customers.\nInventing on behalf of customers\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nExpanded Buy with Prime to all eligible U.S. merchants, letting more merchants offer Prime customers fast, free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and easy returns on their websites. Data shows that shopper conversion increases an average of 25% when merchants use Buy with Prime. Amazon also introduced a capability for Buy with Prime merchants to display customer reviews from Amazon.com within their own online stores and announced an integration with BigCommerce, an ecommerce platform, that will help merchants easily enable Buy with Prime on their storefronts with no coding required.\n•\nIntroduced Sparrow into the company’s first fulfillment center. Sparrow is a robotic system that can detect, select, and handle individual products in Amazon’s inventory—a major technological advancement that allows employees to shift their time and energy to other tasks. Sparrow also improves health and safety by reducing the repetitive tasks done by employees.\n•\nDelivered the 10 millionth package using electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, custom-designed from the ground up with input from delivery services providers and their drivers. With thousands of miles driven, drivers have said the vehicle design and features make their jobs easier and more comfortable, the driving experience is improved, and they feel safe while driving. Amazon plans to have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian on the road by 2030, saving millions of metric tons of carbon per year.\n•\nLaunched Amazon Clinic, a message-based virtual health service that delivers convenient, personalized, affordable care for more than 20 common conditions. Amazon Clinic lets customers choose from a network of leading telehealth providers based on their preferences. Amazon also recently launched RxPass, a new Prime membership benefit from Amazon Pharmacy that offers access to unlimited eligible prescription medications for only $5 per month including free shipping. Amazon’s mission in healthcare is to make it dramatically easier for anyone to find, choose, and afford what they need to get and stay healthy.\n•\nAnnounced AWS Graviton3E chips, which deliver the best price performance for high performance computing workloads on AWS; new AWS Nitro Cards, which deliver the highest network bandwidth, the highest packet rate performance, and the best price performance for network-intensive workloads; and Inf2 instances, powered by AWS Inferentia2 chips, which deliver the lowest latency at the lowest cost for ML inference on Amazon EC2.\n•\nAnnounced Amazon Security Lake, a service that automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake in a customer’s AWS account so customers can act on security data faster.\n•\nAnnounced Amazon DataZone, a new data management service that unlocks customer data across organizational boundaries, including the cloud, on-premises infrastructure, and third-party SaaS applications. With AWS DataZone, customers can catalog, discover, and share data with governance and access controls.\n•\nAnnounced AWS Supply Chain, an application that helps businesses increase supply chain visibility to make faster, more-informed decisions that mitigate risks, lower costs, and improve customer experiences.\n•\nAnnounced AWS SimSpace Weaver, a fully managed simulation service that helps customers build, operate, and run large-scale spatial simulations. With AWS SimSpace Weaver, customers can deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points, like traffic patterns across an entire city, crowd flows in a venue, or factory floor layouts, and use the simulations to visualize physical spaces, perform immersive training, and garner insights on different scenarios to make informed decisions.\n•\nAnnounced AWS Clean Rooms, which helps companies across industries easily and securely analyze and collaborate on combined datasets without sharing or revealing underlying data. AWS Clean Rooms provide a broad set of built-in data access controls to protect sensitive data, while allowing customers to create secure data clean rooms to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, clinical research, and more.\n•\nLaunched Inspire, a feed in the U.S. Amazon shopping app with content from customers, influencers, and brands to help customers discover products personalized for their selected interests.\n•\nPartnered with Snapchat to launch an augmented reality shopping experience that allows millions of Snapchatters to digitally try-on thousands of Amazon eyewear styles via Snapchat and seamlessly purchase those items in the Amazon store. This experience is enabled by Amazon’s 3D Asset technology, which easily integrates with third-party apps like Snapchat, to provide 3D assets for augmented reality-based shopping and dynamically supply up-to-date product details, pricing, and availability.\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service providers. For example, in the fourth quarter, the company:\n•\nSurpassed 100,000 participants in Career Choice, an education benefit that empowers employees to learn new skills for career success through a range of options, including prepaid college tuition, foundational skills training, and industry certifications. In 2022 in the U.S., the company celebrated 3,000 graduates of its new English language proficiency program.\n•\nContinued to make its workplace more accessible and inclusive for employees who are deaf and hard of hearing. For example, Amazon rolled out new video stations over the past year at more than 200 sites across eight countries in North America and Europe to help employees learn the basics of sign language for their region and improve communication with colleagues who are deaf and hard of hearing.\n•\nExpanded the Amazon Mentoring Program to support new people managers with opportunities to receive mentoring from experienced Amazon people managers and develop the foundational skills to be an effective people leader. Since its launch, the program grew from 18,800 employees in 2016 to over 159,000 employees in 2022.\n•\nLaunched a new Alexa feature where customers can say “Alexa, thank my driver” to an Alexa-enabled device, the Alexa app, or the Amazon mobile shopping app, and the driver who delivered their most recent package would be notified. Nearly 8 million “thank yous” have been received.\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\n•\nAdvanced its goal to decarbonize its transportation network globally. For example, Amazon partnered with TVS Motor Company to deploy a fleet of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers for last mile deliveries in India. The agreement is part of Amazon’s plan to bring 10,000 electric delivery vehicles to India by 2025.\n•\nReleased a report detailing Amazon’s progress and methods to reduce packaging, including through the use of innovative technologies, processes, and materials. Since 2015, these efforts have helped reduce the weight of packaging per shipment by 38% and eliminated the use of more than 1.5 million tons of packaging materials. Amazon continues to take steps to reduce single-use plastics in outbound packaging, recently announcing that it reduced average plastic packaging weight per shipment by over 7% in 2021 across its global operations network.\n•\nUnveiled its largest on-site solar energy installation in Europe at a fulfillment center in Seville, Spain that is fitted with more than 13,300 solar panels and is expected to produce more than 6 million kilowatt hours per year—enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 1,500 Spanish homes annually.\n•\nSet a goal for AWS to be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations, and announced that it achieved an industry-leading 2021 global water use efficiency metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour.\n•\nSigned a memorandum of understanding confirming AWS’s continued cooperation in 2023 with the Ukraine government. Since the start of the war, AWS has played a crucial role in helping the Ukraine government maintain continuity and provide critical services to its citizens. To date, Amazon has committed more than $75 million in support to help the people of Ukraine address immediate and long-term needs.\n•\nReleased its latest Community Impact Report, which detailed program milestones, including 85 million pounds of food donated through a partnership with Feeding America; 20 million relief items donated to date; $1.6 billion invested to create or preserve more than 11,000 affordable homes through Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund; computer science education provided to 600,000 students across 5,000 schools through Amazon Future Engineer; and $96 million donated to more than 190 nonprofits in the Puget Sound, Washington region in 2021, making it the Seattle area’s top corporate philanthropist that year.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\nFirst Quarter 2023 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

The customer response to both events was quite positive, and it’s clear that particularly during these uncertain economic times, customers appreciate Amazon’s continued focus on value and convenience,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “We’re also encouraged by the steady progress we’re making on lowering costs in our stores fulfillment network, and have a set of initiatives that we’re methodically working through that we believe will yield a stronger cost structure for the business moving forward. There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we’ll balance our investments to be more streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets. What won’t change is our maniacal focus on the customer experience, and we feel confident that we’re ready to deliver a great experience for customers this holiday shopping season.”\nHighlights\nObsessing over the customer experience\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nPremiered several new entertainment series, including\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n, which attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day, the biggest debut in Prime Video history, and closing in on 100 million viewers to date. The company also premiered three new Original and three returning series, including\nHeidi Klum and Tim Gunn’s\nMaking the Cut\n;\nThe Outlaws\n, starring Christopher Walken and Stephen Merchant;\nand thriller\nThe Peripheral\n,\nstarring Chloë Grace Moretz.\n•\nKicked off the inaugural season of Prime Video as the exclusive home of NFL\nThursday Night Football\nwith more than 15 million viewers for its first game. Live sports also returned to Prime Video across Europe with new seasons of UEFA Champions League soccer in Germany and Italy, Ligue 1 soccer in France, and exclusive coverage of US Open tennis in the UK.\n•\nIntroduced the first-ever Prime Early Access Sale, a two-day shopping event on October 11-12 exclusively for Prime members in 15 countries. Customers could choose from hundreds of thousands of deals across all best-selling categories, such as apparel, home, toys and Amazon devices. Amazon’s selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, also took part in the event, and customers responded by ordering more than 100 million items from these businesses.\n•\nOpened a dozen new fulfillment centers globally in order to serve more customers even more quickly. New sites were opened in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and Turkey.\n•\nExpanded to Belgium with the launch of Amazon.com.be and a Prime program for local customers, providing faster access to more than 180 million products across more than 30 product categories. As part of the launch, Amazon introduced the “Brands of Belgium” storefront to showcase products from Belgian entrepreneurs.\n•\nPartnered with new brands and retailers to make their products available on Amazon with same-day delivery for Prime members in select ZIP codes across over 10 U.S. cities. Examples of these partners include GNC, PacSun, SuperDry, Sur La Table, and 100% Pure.\n•\nContinued working to protect customers from fake reviews through legal action against fake review brokers, filing its first criminal complaint in Italy and its first lawsuit in Spain. These two legal proceedings, plus 10 other new lawsuits recently launched in the U.S., target bad actors that operate more than 11,000 websites and social media groups that attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon and other stores. Amazon stops millions of suspicious reviews before customers ever see them, and these legal actions help uncover perpetrators and stop the abuse where it starts.\n•\nRolled out Venmo as a new payment option in the U.S., giving customers more choice during the checkout experience.\n•\nHosted Amazon Accelerate, an annual conference dedicated to seller success where numerous new tools were introduced, including new email marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates, and new features and analytics on conversion-driving content.\n•\nAnnounced new commitments and migrations from AWS customers across many industries and geographies, such as BMW Group, which extended its work to help BMW’s developers derive insights from the data their vehicles produce; grocery delivery service Schwan’s Home Delivery, which is optimizing delivery times across its routes, building and scaling its technology infrastructure to support evolving consumer preferences, and personalizing product recommendations; online grocery platform Pick n Pay, which migrated its entire on-premises SAP environment to AWS to automate operations and deliver real-time insights; German national football league Bundesliga, which debuted two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to help fans better understand team performance and\ngame strategy; and South Korea-based wireless telecommunications operator SK Telecom (SKT), which is making it easier and more cost-effective for customers to build, use, and scale computer vision applications.\n•\nContinued to expand AWS’s infrastructure footprint to support customers, announcing plans to launch the AWS Asia Pacific (Bangkok) Region in Thailand and opening the second Region in the Middle East, the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region.\n•\nReceived CrowdStrike’s 2022 Ecosystem Partner of the year award for AWS. Together, CrowdStrike and AWS delivered end-to-end comprehensive protection that enables AWS customers to build, run, and secure applications with speed and confidence.\nInventing on behalf of customers\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:\n•\nIntroduced a range of new Fire TV devices and entertainment experiences, including the Omni QLED Series smart TV with hands-free Alexa controls and new ambient features that turn the TV into an always-smart device when not streaming; and the all-new Fire TV Cube streaming media player with a faster processor for increased app launch speeds, an industry-first HDMI input port, and Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming.\n•\nIntroduced the next generation of Echo Dot and Echo Auto, as well as upgrades to Echo Studio.

One or both of these technologies are now available at Texas A&M’s Kyle Field, Lumen Field in Seattle, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and a Hudson Nonstop at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Amazon also continued to roll out Amazon One at Whole Foods Market stores with the technology now available at over 65 stores in California.\n•\nAnnounced the general availability of new AWS EC2 machine learning training instances (Trn1), which make it possible to build more accurate machine learning models and reduce training times. AWS-designed Trainium chips are purpose-built for high-performance machine learning training in the cloud. With Trainium-powered Trn1 instances, AWS customers can save up to 50% on deep learning training costs over equivalent GPU-based instances.\n•\nAnnounced the general availability of AWS IoT FleetWise, which makes it easier to collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors can use the data to analyze vehicle fleet health and more quickly identify potential recalls or safety issues, make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter, and improve advanced technologies like autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems with analytics and machine learning.\n•\nAnnounced a new alliance and investment with Harvard University to advance fundamental research and innovation in quantum networking, which will explore applications to combat privacy and security threats. AWS also announced the AWS Generation Q Fund at the Harvard Quantum Initiative to train the next-generation of quantum scientists and engineers.\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service providers. There is a long list of initiatives the company continues to pursue. For example, in the third quarter, the company:\n•\nAnnounced it is investing nearly $1 billion in pay increases for its fulfillment network employees over the next year in the U.S., bringing average pay to more than $19 per hour.\n•\nExpanded Anytime Pay to provide hourly employees with instant access to up to 70% of their pay at any time during the month.\n•\nCelebrated the 10-year anniversary of Career Choice, an education benefit that empowers employees to learn new skills for career success and has seen over 90,000 employees participate so far.\n•\nAnnounced it is investing more than $450 million over the next year to help Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) support their teams with access to new and improved benefits, and additional rate increases. One new benefits provider, Next Mile, offers drivers employed by participating DSPs access to more than 1,700 academic programs with tuition assistance from their DSP. Participating DSPs are eligible to receive up to $5,250 per driver per year from Amazon to help cover the costs of tuition assistance.\n•\nExpanded career advancement and development programs for front-line employees, such as offering the Amazon Intelligence Initiative to enhance technical skills and place employees in engineering roles within AWS.\n•\nAnnounced plans to hire 150,000 people for open seasonal, full-time, and part-time roles across its operations network in the U.S. to help deliver for customers during the holidays.\n•\nIntroduced an additional, free mental wellness program for employees and their families in the U.S., the UK, and Brazil. Offered through Twill Therapeutics, the tools and services to improve mental health are available 24/7 and can be used to address in-the-moment concerns or as part of a daily mental health and well-being routine.\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a small sampling of the many efforts from this past quarter include Amazon:\n•\nSupporting people affected by Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida by providing hundreds of thousands of essential products such as water filters and medical supplies; sending more than 320,000 bottles of water to residents of Jackson, Mississippi, suffering from a shortage of clean water; and donating items such as blankets and flashlights after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Sichuan Luding, China.\n•\nContinuing to support people impacted by the war in Ukraine with product donations to refugees, financial support to more than 150 nonprofits on the ground in Eastern Europe, and cloud credits and technological assistance through AWS. As part of the support for the Ukrainian government, AWS sent Snowball devices—ruggedized compute and storage hardware—into Ukraine to help secure, store, and transfer over 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential data to the cloud. These Snowball devices were the foundation for the effort to preserve Ukraine’s data—including state registries, education records, and other essential databases—which are critical in rebuilding the country. Amazon has donated more than $45 million in assistance since the start of the war and waived the referral fee for all Ukrainian small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon’s European stores. In addition, AWS launched IT Skills 4U, a free workforce-development initiative to provide Ukrainians around the world with access to skills training.\n•\nCommitting to hire at least 5,000 refugees in the U.S. by the end of 2024. The company is also providing support and resources through its Welcome Door program, which launched in April 2022 to help refugee employees navigate the immigration process.\n•\nCommitting $147 million to create and preserve 1,260 affordable homes across the Washington, D.C., metro area in partnership with minority-led organizations. This investment is the latest initiative by the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment to create and preserve affordable homes in Amazon’s hometown communities.\n•\nAnnouncing plans to invest more than €1 billion over the next five years to further electrify and decarbonize its transportation network across Europe. This includes investments in electric trucks, vans, and micro mobility solutions like e-cargo bikes, as well as charging infrastructure.\n•\nAnnouncing agreements with Plug Power to supply 10,950 tons of green hydrogen per year for Amazon’s transportation and building operations, and with Infinium to bring clean-burning electrofuels to Amazon’s middle mile transportation fleet starting next year.\n•\nAnnouncing 71 new renewable energy projects globally, including its first project in Brazil and its first solar farms in India and Poland, building on Amazon’s position as the leading corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world.\n•\nExtending its partnership with Water.org, donating $10 million to help launch the Water.org Water & Climate Fund. The fund is focused on climate-resilient water and sanitation solutions that will result in lasting access for 100 million people across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In addition, Amazon’s funding will help provide 1 million people with access to clean water by 2025.\n•\nLaunching Amazon Catalytic Capital to invest $150 million in venture capital funds, accelerators, incubators, and venture studios that provide funding to entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds.\n•\nAnnouncing AWS has now helped more than 13 million people globally gain access to free cloud computing skills training since 2020 as part of Amazon’s commitment to provide free training to 29 million people around the world by 2025.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 27, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of October 27, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\nFourth Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $140.0 billion and $148.0 billion, or to grow between 2% and 8% compared with fourth quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 460 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.5 billion in fourth quarter 2021.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

Second quarter 2022 net loss includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $3.9 billion included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc.\n“\nDespite continued inflationary pressures in fuel, energy, and transportation costs, we’re making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter, particularly improving the productivity of our fulfillment network,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “We’re also seeing revenue accelerate as we continue to make Prime even better for members, both investing in faster shipping speeds, and adding unique benefits such as free delivery from Grubhub for a year,\nexclusive access to\nNFL\nThursday Night\nFootball\ngames\nstarting September 15\n, and releasing the highly anticipated series\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\non September 2.”\nHighlights\nShopping Innovation\n•\nPrime members worldwide shopped more and saved more this Prime Day than any other Prime Day event, purchasing more than 300 million items and saving more than $1.7 billion. On July 12 and July 13, Prime members worldwide purchased more than 100,000 items per minute, and some of the best-selling categories were Amazon Devices, Consumer Electronics, and Home. Amazon Devices had a record-breaking Prime Day, selling more devices than any other Prime Day event.\n•\nPrime continued to provide even more value to members around the world. In the U.S., Amazon introduced new offers for Prime members, including a free one-year Grubhub+ membership, a new year-round 20% discount on select\neveryday essentials at Amazon Fresh stores, and exclusive deals on home entertainment items and merchandise to help prepare for NFL\nThursday Night Football\n. Additionally, Prime Student members get six months free of a LinkedIn Premium subscription.\n•\nAmazon introduced new ways for customers to support and discover small businesses selling in Amazon’s store, including the Small Business Badge, which helps customers find and shop products from small business brands and artisans, and\nThis Is Small Business\n, a new podcast dedicated to sharing stories from small business owners about pivotal moments in starting, building, and scaling their businesses. This year was also the biggest Prime Day event for Amazon’s selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, whose sales growth in Amazon’s store outpaced Amazon’s first-party sales. Customers spent over $3 billion on more than 100 million small business items included in the Support Small Businesses to Win Big sweepstakes, which offered customers the chance to win prizes when shopping from small businesses leading up to Prime Day.\n•\nAmazon continues to invent new fashion shopping experiences for customers, launching Virtual Try-On for Shoes, where shoppers can virtually try on thousands of sneaker styles, and Luxury Stores at Amazon in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, where customers can shop established and emerging luxury fashion brands online. Amazon Style, Amazon’s first-ever physical store for apparel, opened in Glendale, California, to help customers discover new looks through a personalized shopping experience. Amazon Style uses machine learning algorithms to produce tailored recommendations for customers as they shop. In the fitting room, customers can use touchscreens to browse more options and request additional styles and sizes. Amazon also expanded its selection of size-inclusive fashion to include a collection from designer Jonathan Cohen and a new co-brand between Amazon and\nMaking The Cut\nSeason Two winner Andrea Pitter called TEREA.\n•\nAmazon announced that later this year, Amazon customers in Lockeford, California, and College Station, Texas, will be among the first to receive Prime Air drone deliveries in the U.S. Customers will have the option to receive free and fast drone delivery on thousands of everyday items—the largest selection of items ever to be available for drone delivery.\n•\nAmazon continues to collaborate with leading retailers and stadiums to equip third-party locations with Just Walk Out technology for checkout-free shopping and Amazon One for palm recognition and payment service. Recent store openings include the Walk-Off Market food and beverage store at T-Mobile Park in Seattle and the Hudson Nonstop store in Nashville International Airport. Additionally, three stores will open at Texas A&M’s Kyle Field later this year. The combination of technologies gives shoppers the option to enter a store by inserting their credit card at the entry gate or hovering their palm over an Amazon One device. Once inside, shoppers can take what they want and leave without stopping to check out.\n•\nAmazon continued to expand its grocery store footprint by opening 12 Amazon Fresh stores across the U.S. and the UK, and introduced new innovations to improve the shopping experience for customers, including the next generation Amazon Dash Cart. Amazon Dash Cart is a smart shopping cart that uses computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion to help identify items placed in a cart, so customers can skip the checkout line when they are done shopping. With the new Dash Cart, which is also expanding to its first Whole Foods Market store, shoppers can fit more items into their cart, bring the cart to their car, and easily search for specific items on the cart’s screen.\n•\nAmazon announced Store Analytics, a new service that provides brands with aggregated and anonymized insights about the performance of their products, promotions, and ad campaigns in applicable stores. Store Analytics is available at Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. that are enabled with Just Walk Out technology and Amazon Dash Carts.\n•\nAmazon continues to improve its shopping experience for U.S. customers who use SNAP EBT, the federal program that helps families purchase groceries. The company expanded the program so that beneficiaries in 48 states and Washington, D.C.—covering more than 99% of SNAP households—can now use their SNAP benefits to shop for groceries at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market.\n•\nAmazon released its second Brand Protection Report, which details how the company safeguards customers, brands, and selling partners from counterfeit products. Amazon identified, seized, and appropriately disposed of more than 3 million counterfeit products, preventing them from harming customers or being resold elsewhere in the retail supply chain. In 2021, the company employed more than 12,000 people and invested more than $900 million to protect its store from counterfeit, fraud, and other forms of abuse so customers can continue to shop with confidence.\n•\nAmazon filed legal action against the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups that attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon in exchange for money or free products. These groups are set up to recruit individuals willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews on Amazon’s stores in the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Amazon will use information discovered from this legal action to identify bad actors and remove fake\nreviews commissioned by these fraudsters that haven’t already been detected by Amazon’s advanced technology, expert investigators, and continuous monitoring.\n•\nAmazon Ads launched Amazon Marketing Stream (Beta), a product that automatically delivers hourly Sponsored Products campaign metrics to advertisers or agencies through the Amazon Ads API. The Stream provides near real-time performance insights to enable more effective campaign optimization, more agility in responding to campaign changes, and increased operational efficiency to help drive business growth for advertisers.\n•\nThe second re:MARS conference took place in Las Vegas, and Amazon welcomed nearly 7,000 attendees, in person and virtually, to hear from top academics and experts in machine learning, automation, robotics, and space. This year’s event featured innovations from across Amazon, along with demos of Amazon’s Just Walk Out Experiential Mock Store, Boston Dynamics’ Spot® agile robot on AWS, Alexa Smart Home featuring the Astro household robot, and the Lunar Outpost lunar surface rover built on AWS.\nEntertainment\n•\nFormer NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman will join Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez as analysts for Prime Video’s NFL\nThursday Night Football\npregame, halftime, and postgame coverage. Veteran sports anchor Charissa Thompson will host the shows. Legendary sportscaster Al Michaels and Emmy-winning analyst Kirk Herbstreit will call the live action games.\n•\nPrime Video received 30 Emmy nominations, and MGM received seven nominations. Prime Video’s nominations included\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n,\nLucy and Desi\n,\nLizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls\n,\nThe Academy of Country Music Awards\n,\nThe Boys Presents: Diabolical\n,\nGoliath\n,\nSavage X Fenty Show\n, and\nA Very British Scandal\n.

Our Consumer business has grown 23% annually over the past two years, with extraordinary growth in 2020 of 39% year-over-year that necessitated doubling the size of our fulfillment network that we’d built over Amazon’s first 25 years—and doing so in just 24 months. Today, as we’re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we’re now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020.”\nHighlights\nShopping\n•\nAmazon announced Buy with Prime, a new benefit for Prime members in the U.S. that extends the convenience of shopping with Prime to online stores beyond Amazon.com.

Amazon launched two humanitarian aid hubs in Slovakia and Poland, with more than 90,000 square feet of dedicated logistics space to expedite relief products to Ukrainian refugees. Through the hub, Amazon has delivered more than 1 million clothing items, first-aid products, food items, hygiene products, and medical supplies. Amazon also donated more than $10 million in cash to more than 150 nonprofits working on the ground, committed technological assistance and more than $15 million in free cloud credits to organizations addressing the humanitarian crisis, and provided free\nlegal assistance to organizations helping refugees seek resettlement in Europe.

HQ2 will be powered with 100% renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects. Amazon plans to create 25,000 direct jobs in Arlington over the next decade, which together with the company’s investment in the surrounding area will help generate thousands of indirect jobs across the region.\n•\nAmazon Future Engineer, the company’s global computer science education program for students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities, awarded $40,000 college scholarships to 250 students across the U.S. to study computer science. Since launching this program four years ago, Amazon has awarded $22 million in scholarships to 550 students who are also granted paid internships at Amazon.\n•\nAmazon introduced new tools for sellers including New Seller Incentives, a suite of benefits (such as bonuses, credits, and discounts) worth more than $50,000 in potential value, and the Perfect Launch playbook, a tool with actionable steps for new-to-Amazon selling partners.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of April 28, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\nSecond Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $116.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 7% compared with second quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income (loss) is expected to be between $(1.0) billion and $3.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second quarter 2021.\n•\nThis guidance assumes that Prime Day occurs in third quarter 2022.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic conditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

But, this is the first time I’ve had the honor of writing our annual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Jeff set the bar high on these letters, and I will try to keep them worth reading.\nWhen the pandemic started in early 2020, few people thought it would be as expansive or long-running as it’s been. Whatever role Amazon played in the world up to that point became further magnified as most physical venues shut down for long periods of time and people spent their days at home. This meant that hundreds of millions of people relied on Amazon for PPE, food, clothing, and various other items that helped them navigate this unprecedented time. Businesses and governments also had to shift, practically overnight, from working with colleagues and technology on-premises to working remotely. AWS played a major role in enabling this business continuity. Whether companies saw extraordinary demand spikes, or demand diminish quickly with reduced external consumption, the cloud’s elasticity to scale capacity up and down quickly, as well as AWS’s unusually broad functionality helped millions of companies adjust to these difficult circumstances.\nOur AWS and Consumer businesses have had different demand trajectories during the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, AWS revenue continued to grow at a rapid clip—30% year over year (“YoY”) in 2020 on a $35 billion annual revenue base in 2019—but slower than the 37% YoY growth in 2019. This was due in part to the uncertainty and slowing demand that so many businesses encountered, but also in part to our helping companies optimize their AWS footprint to save money. Concurrently, companies were stepping back and determining what they wanted to change coming out of the pandemic. Many concluded that they didn’t want to continue managing their technology infrastructure themselves, and made the decision to accelerate their move to the cloud. This shift by so many companies (along with the economy recovering) helped re-accelerate AWS’s revenue growth to 37% YoY in 2021.\nConversely, our Consumer revenue grew dramatically in 2020. In 2020, Amazon’s North America and International Consumer revenue grew 39% YoY on the very large 2019 revenue base of $245 billion; and, this extraordinary growth extended into 2021 with revenue increasing 43% YoY in Q1 2021. These are astounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years’ forecasted growth in about 15 months.\nAs the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel, consumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren’t sure what to expect in 2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compounded annual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for them during the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.\nThis growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand. As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challenging both to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventory as close to customers as we typically do. Combined with ocean, air, and trucking capacity becoming scarcer and more expensive, this created extra transportation and productivity costs. Supply chains were disrupted in ways none of us had seen previously. We hoped that the major impact from COVID-19 would recede as 2021 drew to a close, but then omicron reared its head in December, which had worldwide ramifications, including impacting people’s ability to work. And then in late February, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuel costs and inflation became bigger issues with which to contend.\nSo, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I’m proud of the incredible commitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I’m not sure any of us would have gotten\n​\nthrough the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams during this period, and I’m eternally grateful.\nIt’s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It’s because we weren’t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we’re constantly experimenting and inventing. We’re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they’re our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf.\nPeople often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody’s head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto—you have a new invention that’s a breakaway success for a long time. That’s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time.\nLet me give you some Amazon examples.\nOur Fulfillment Network\n: Going back to the pandemic, there’s no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We’d been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as we desire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years building out an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, and reconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities. For perspective, in 2004, we had seven fulfillment centers in the U.S. and four in other parts of the world, and we hadn’t yet added delivery stations, which connect our fulfillment and sortation centers to the last-mile delivery vans you see driving around your neighborhood. Fast forward to the end of 2021, we had 253 fulfillment centers, 110 sortation centers, and 467 delivery stations in North America, with an additional 157 fulfillment centers, 58 sortation centers, and 588 delivery stations across the globe. Our delivery network grew to more than 260,000 drivers worldwide, and our Amazon Air cargo fleet has more than 100 aircraft. This has represented a capital investment of over $100 billion and countless iterations and small process improvements by over a million Amazonians in the last decade and a half.\nIronically, just before COVID started, we’d made the decision to invest billions of incremental dollars over several years to deliver an increasing number of Prime shipments in one day. This initiative was slowed by the challenges of the pandemic, but we’ve since resumed our focus here. Delivering a substantial amount of shipments in one day is hard (especially across the millions of items that we offer) and initially expensive as we build out the infrastructure to scale this efficiently. But, we believe our over 200 million Prime customers, who will tell you very clearly that faster is almost always better, will love this. So, this capability to ship millions of items within a couple days (and increasingly one day) was not from one aha moment and not developed in a year or two. It’s been hard-earned by putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, knowing what they wanted, organizing Amazonians to work together to invent better solutions, and investing a large amount of financial and people resources over 20 years (often well in advance of when it would pay out). This type of iterative innovation is never finished and has periodic peaks in investment years, but leads to better long-term customer experiences, customer loyalty, and returns for our shareholders.\nAWS\n: As we were defining AWS and working backwards on the services we thought customers wanted, we kept triggering one of the biggest tensions in product development—where to draw the line on functionality in V1. One early meeting in particular—for our core compute service called Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”)—\n​\nwas scheduled for an hour, and took three, as we animatedly debated whether we could launch a compute service without an accompanying persistent block storage companion (a form of network attached storage).\n​\nEverybody agreed that having a persistent block store was important to a complete compute service; however, to have one ready would take an extra year. The question became could we offer customers a useful service where they could get meaningful value before we had all the features we thought they wanted? We decided that the initial launch of EC2 could be feature-poor if we also organized ourselves to listen to customers and iterate quickly. This approach works well if you indeed iterate quickly; but, is disastrous if you can’t. We launched EC2 in 2006 with one instance size, in one data center, in one region of the world, with Linux operating system instances only (no Windows), without monitoring, load balancing, auto-scaling, or yes, persistent storage. EC2 was an initial success, but nowhere near the multi-billion-dollar service it’s become until we added the missing capabilities listed above, and then some.\nIn the early days of AWS, people sometimes asked us why compute wouldn’t just be an undifferentiated commodity. But, there’s a lot more to compute than just a server. Customers want various flavors of compute (e.g. server configurations optimized for storage, memory, high-performance compute, graphics rendering, machine learning), multiple form factors (e.g. fixed instance sizes, portable containers, serverless functions), various sizes and optimizations of persistent storage, and a slew of networking capabilities. Then, there’s the CPU chip that runs in your compute. For many years, the industry had used Intel or AMD x86 processors. We have important partnerships with these companies, but realized that if we wanted to push price and performance further (as customers requested), we’d have to develop our own chips, too. Our first generalized chip was Graviton, which we announced in 2018. This helped a subset of customer workloads run more cost-effectively than prior options. But, it wasn’t until 2020, after taking the learnings from Graviton and innovating on a new chip, that we had something remarkable with our Graviton2 chip, which provides up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86 processors. Think about how much of an impact 40% improvement on compute is. Compute is used for every bit of technology. That’s a huge deal for customers. And, while Graviton2 has been a significant success thus far (48 of the top 50 AWS EC2 customers have already adopted it), the AWS Chips team was already learning from what customers said could be better, and announced Graviton3 this past December (offering a 25% improvement on top of Graviton2’s relative gains). The list of what we’ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS in general) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customers much more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), but also allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.\nDevices\n: Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated industrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold), but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (now millions) in 60 seconds—and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, we launched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and a gyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences). The phone was unsuccessful, and though we determined we were probably too late to this party and directed these resources elsewhere, we hired some fantastic long-term builders and learned valuable lessons from this failure that have served us well in devices like Echo and FireTV.\nWhen I think of the first Echo device—and what Alexa could do for customers at that point—it was noteworthy, yet so much less capable than what’s possible today. Today, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices out there (in homes, offices, cars, hotel rooms, Amazon Echo devices, and third-party manufacturer devices); you can listen to music—or watch videos now; you can control your lights and home automation; you can create routines like “Start My Day” where Alexa tells you the weather, your estimated commute time based on current traffic, then plays the news; you can easily order retail items on Amazon; you can get general or customized news, updates on sporting events and related stats—and we’re still quite early with respect to what Alexa and Alexa-related devices will do for customers. Our goal is for Alexa to be the world’s most helpful and resourceful personal assistant, who makes people’s lives meaningfully easier and better. We have a lot more inventing and iterating to go, but customers continue to indicate that we’re on the right path. We have several other devices at varying stages of evolution (e.g. Ring and Blink provide the leading digital home security solutions, Astro is a brand new home robot that we just launched in late 2021), but it’s safe to say that every one of our devices, whether you’re talking about Kindle, FireTV, Alexa/Echo, Ring, Blink, or Astro is an invention-in-process with a lot more coming that will keep improving customers’ lives.\n​\nPrime Video\n: We started in 2006 with an offering called Amazon Unbox where customers could download about a thousand movies from major studios. This made sense as bandwidth was slower those days (it would take an hour to download a video). But, as bandwidth got much faster to people’s homes and mobile devices, along with the advent of connected TVs, streaming was going to be a much better customer solution, and we focused our efforts on streaming. In 2011, we started offering over 5,000 streaming movies and shows as part of customers’ Amazon Prime subscriptions. Initially, all of our content was produced by other studios and entertainment companies. These deals were expensive, country-specific, and only available to us for a limited period; so, to expand our options, we started creating our own original shows. Our early efforts included short-lived shows like\nAlpha House\nand\nBetas\n, before we had our first award-winning series in\nTransparent\n, and eventually created multi-year franchises in\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n,\nThe Boys\n,\nBosch\n, and\nJack Ryan\n. Along the way, we’ve learned a lot about producing compelling entertainment with memorable moments and using machine learning and other inventive technology to provide a superior-quality streaming experience (with useful, relevant data about actors, TV shows, movies, music, or sports stats a click away in our unique X-Ray feature). You might have seen some of this in action in our recent new hit series,\nReacher\n, and you’ll hopefully see it in our upcoming Lord of the Rings series launch (coming Labor Day 2022). We also expect that you’ll see this iterative invention when we launch\nThursday Night Football\n, the NFL’s first weekly, prime time, streaming-only broadcast, airing exclusively on Prime Video starting in September 2022. Our agreement with the NFL is for 11 years, and we will work relentlessly over the next several years to reinvent the NFL viewing experience for football fans.\nThis track record of frequent invention is not only why more sports entities are choosing to work with Prime Video, but also why so many large entertainment companies have become Prime Video Channels partners. Channels is a program that enables entertainment companies to leverage Prime Video’s unique technology and viewing experience, as well as its very large member base to offer monthly subscriptions to their content. Companies like Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Starz, Corus Entertainment, and Globo have found that they’re driving substantial incremental membership and better customer experience through Channels. While there is so much progress in Prime Video from where we started, we have more invention in front of us in the next 15 years than the last 15—and our team is passionately committed to providing customers with the most expansive collection of compelling content anywhere in the world.\nThis same sort of iterative invention can be applied to efforts supporting people and communities. Last summer, we added two new Leadership Principles:\nStrive to be Earth’s Best Employer\nand\nSuccess and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility\n. These concepts were always implicit at Amazon, but explicit Leadership Principles help us ask ourselves—and empower more Amazonians at all levels to ask—whether we’re living up to these principles.\nFor example, more than a million Amazonians work in our fulfillment network. In 2018, we championed the $15 minimum wage (which is more than double the federal minimum wage), but haven’t stopped there. We continued to increase compensation such that our average starting hourly salary is currently over $18. Along with this compensation, we offer very robust benefits, including full health insurance, a 401K plan, up to 20 weeks of parental leave, and full tuition coverage for associates who want to get a college education (whether they remain with us or not). We’re not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees. We’ve researched and created a list of what we believe are the top 100 employee experience pain points and are systematically solving them. We’re also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries. Our injury rates are sometimes misunderstood. We have operations jobs that fit both the “warehousing” and “courier and delivery” categories. In the last U.S. public numbers, our recordable incident rates were a little higher than the average of our warehousing peers (6.4 vs. 5.5), and a little lower than the average of our courier and delivery peers (7.6 vs. 9.1). This makes us about average relative to peers, but we don’t seek to be average. We want to be best in class. When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly. I didn’t find that. At our scale (we hired over 300,000 people in 2021 alone, many of whom were new to this sort of work and needed training), it takes rigorous analysis, thoughtful problem-solving, and a willingness to invent to get to where you want. We’ve been dissecting every process path to discern how we can further improve. We have a variety of programs in flight (e.g. rotational programs that help employees avoid spending too much time doing the same repetitive motions, wearables that prompt employees when\n​\nthey’re moving in a dangerous way, improved shoes to provide better toe protection, training programs on body mechanics, wellness, and safety practices). But, we still have a ways to go, and we’ll approach it like we do other customer experiences—we’ll keep learning, inventing, and iterating until we have more transformational results. We won’t be satisfied until we do.\nSimilarly, at our scale, we have a significant carbon footprint. It’s a big part of why we created The Climate Pledge a few years ago (a pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement). We’re making significant progress on this effort (we’re committed to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030, we have ordered over 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages, and have over 300 companies who’ve joined us in The Climate Pledge). But, we have a different challenge than most companies given the diversity and intensity of our operations (including shipping billions of packages per year). We’re committed to the challenge, but it will take relentless invention.\nWe also are trying to increase the amount of affordable housing in the communities in which we have a large presence. Our more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund that we started a year ago has already allocated $1.2 billion toward affordable housing initiatives in the areas around Washington state’s Puget Sound region, Arlington (Virginia), and Nashville (Tennessee).\nA final quick example is Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network that we’re spending over $10 billion to build in the next several years. Kuiper will serve customers with minimal to no fixed broadband connectivity, changing access to information and resources for many communities (analysts estimate approximately 300-400 million customers globally are in this category). We’re optimistic that there is a pretty good business model for us too, but we’ll see—and it’s a real game changer for underserved families and businesses that will unfold over many years as we keep evolving its capabilities.\nThis type of iterative innovation is pervasive across every team at Amazon. I could have given comparable examples in Advertising, Grocery, Gaming, Amazon Music, Amazon Care (our telemedicine offering), or Pharmacy, to name a few. All of these stories are still being written as we rapidly experiment, learn, and continue to try to make our customer experience better every day.\nIf this approach sounds appealing, a natural question is what’s required to get good at it? It’s easier said than done, but here are some components that have helped us:\n1/\nHire the Right Builders\n: We disproportionately index in hiring builders. We think of builders as people who like to invent, who look at customer experiences, dissect what doesn’t work well about them, and seek to reinvent them. We want people who keep asking why can’t it be done? We want people who like to experiment and tinker, and who realize launch is the starting line, not the finish line.\n2/\nOrganize Builders into Teams That Are as Separable and Autonomous as Possible\n: It’s hard for teams to be deep in what customers care about in multiple areas. It’s also hard to spend enough time on the new initiatives when there’s resource contention with the more mature businesses; the surer bets usually win out. Single-threaded teams will know their customers’ needs better, spend all their waking work hours inventing for them, and develop context and tempo to keep iterating quickly.\n3/\nGive Teams the Right Tools and Permission to Move Fast\n: Speed is not pre-ordained. It’s a leadership choice. It has trade-offs, but you can’t wake up one day and start moving fast. It requires having the right tools to experiment and build fast (a major part of why we started AWS), allowing teams to make two-way door decisions themselves, and setting an expectation that speed matters. And, it does. Speed is disproportionally important to every business at every stage of its evolution. Those that move slower than their competitive peers fall away over time.\n4/\nYou Need Blind Faith, But No False Hope\n: This is a lyric from one of my favorite Foo Fighters songs (“Congregation”). When you invent, you come up with new ideas that people will reject because they haven’t been done before (that’s where the blind faith comes in), but it’s also important to step back and make sure you have a viable plan that’ll resonate with customers (avoid false hope). We’re lucky that we have builders who challenge each other, feedback loops that give us access to customer feedback, and a product\n​\ndevelopment process of working backwards from the customer where having to write a Press Release (to flesh out the customer benefits) and a Frequently Asked Questions document (to detail how we’d build it) helps us have blind faith without false hope (at least usually).\n5/\nDefine a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP), and Be Willing to Iterate Fast\n: Figuring out where to draw the line for launch is one of the most difficult decisions teams must make. Often, teams wait too long, and insist on too many bells and whistles, before launching. And, they miss the first mover advantage or opportunity to build mindshare in fast-moving market segments before well-executing peers get too far ahead. The launch product must be good enough that you believe it’ll be loved from the get-go (why we call it a “Minimum Loveable Product” vs. a “Minimum Viable Product”), but in newer market segments, teams are often better off getting this MLP to customers and iterating quickly thereafter.\n6/\nAdopt a Long-term Orientation\n: We’re sometimes criticized at Amazon for not shutting much down. It’s true that we have a longer tolerance for our investments than most companies. But, we know that transformational invention takes multiple years, and if you’re making big bets that you believe could substantially change customer experience (and your company), you have to be in it for the long-haul or you’ll give up too quickly.\n7/\nBrace Yourself for Failure\n: If you invent a lot, you will fail more often than you wish. Nobody likes this part, but it comes with the territory. When it’s clear that we’ve launched something that won’t work, we make sure we’ve learned from what didn’t go well, and secure great landing places for team members who delivered well—or your best people will hesitate to work on new initiatives.\nAlbert Einstein is sometimes credited with describing compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world (“He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn’t, pays it”). We think of iterative innovation in much the same way. Iterative innovation creates magic for customers. Constantly inventing and improving products for customers has a compounding effect on the customer experience, and in turn on a business’s prospects.\nTime is your friend when you are compounding gains. Amazon is a big company with some large businesses, but it’s still early days for us. We will continue to be insurgent—inventing in businesses that we’re in, in new businesses that we’ve yet to launch, and in new ideas that we haven’t even imagined yet. It remains Day 1.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n​\n1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n​\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\nTo our shareholders:\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\nIt’s All About the Long Term\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the\nlong term\n. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n•\nWe will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n​\n​\n•\nWe will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n​\n•\nWhen forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\n​\n•\nWe will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n​\n•\nWe will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n​\n•\nWe will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n​\n•\nWe will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n​\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.\nObsess Over Customers\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\nto‑search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click\nSM\nshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n•\nSales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.\n​\n•\nCumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.\n​\n•\nThe percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n​\n•\nIn terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\ntop 20.\n​\n•\nWe established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n​\n​\nInfrastructure\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:\n•\nAmazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.\n​\n•\nDistribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n​\n•\nInventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n​\n•\nOur cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\n​\nOur Employees\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.\nGoals for 1998\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P.

Given the extraordinary growth we saw in 2020 when customers predominantly stayed home, and the fact that we’ve continued to grow on top of that in 2021, our Retail teammates have effectively operated in peak mode for almost two years. It’s been a tremendous effort, and I’m appreciative and proud of how hard our teams have worked to serve customers,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic. When you combine\nhow we’re staffing and scaling our fulfillment network to bring even faster delivery to more customers, the extraordinary growth of AWS with 40% year-over-year growth (and now a $71 billion revenue run rate), the addition of marquee new entertainment like\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nand\nThursday Night Football,\nand a plethora of new capabilities that we’re building in areas like Alexa, Ring, Grocery, Pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper, and Zoox, there’s a lot to look forward to in the months and years ahead.”\nAmazon also continues to invest heavily in Prime.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\nFirst Quarter 2022 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More\ninformation about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2021.\n•\nOperating cash flow\ndecreased 1% to $54.7 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $55.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\n•\nFree cash flow\ndecreased to $2.6 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $29.5 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\n•\nFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations\ndecreased to an outflow of $8.8 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an inflow of $18.4 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\n•\nFree cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations\ndecreased to an outflow of $3.9 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an inflow of $17.9 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\n•\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards\ntotaled 523 million on September 30, 2021, compared with 518 million one year ago.\n•\nNet sales\nincreased 15% to $110.8 billion in the third quarter, compared with $96.1 billion in third quarter 2020. Excluding the $0.5 billion favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 15% compared with third quarter 2020.\n•\nOperating income\ndecreased to $4.9 billion in the third quarter, compared with $6.2 billion in third quarter 2020.\n•\nNet income\ndecreased to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, or $6.12 per diluted share, compared with $6.3 billion, or $12.37 per diluted share, in third quarter 2020.\n“We’ve always said that when confronted with the choice between optimizing for short-term profits versus what’s best for customers over the long term, we will choose the latter—and you can see that during every phase of this pandemic,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “In the first several months of COVID-19, Amazonians played an essential role to help people secure the requisite PPE, food, and other in-demand items needed, and we worked closely with businesses and governments to leverage AWS to maintain business continuity as they responded to the pandemic. Customers have appreciated this commitment, which is part of what’s driving this past quarter’s AWS growth acceleration to 39% year over year; but, it’s also driven extraordinary investments across our businesses to satisfy customer needs—just one example is that we’ve nearly doubled the size of our fulfillment network since the pandemic began. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season. It’ll be expensive for us in the short term, but it’s the right prioritization for our customers and partners.”\nHighlights\nInnovating for Our Retail Customers\n•\nAmazon kicked off the holidays early this year, announcing Black Friday-worthy deals on October 4, including thousands of deals from independent sellers and handmade artisans and Amazon’s biggest ever selection of gift guides. Amazon launched new features like the Holiday Gift List to let customers easily create and share one list of gift ideas\nfor everyone in their household, conveniently organized by recipients. The company also unveiled its new Holiday Prep Shop, which expertly curates top products across various categories to help customers prepare for seasonal celebrations.\n•\nAmazon expanded its faster Same-Day Delivery service to Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Minneapolis, and Tampa—bringing the total number of cities with the service, which launched in 2020, to 15. The expansion has led to hundreds of new Amazon jobs in these cities offering competitive hourly wages and a flexible work schedule. Prime members can shop up to 3 million items across a dozen categories, such as baby, beauty and health, and electronics, and receive their order in as fast as five hours.\n•\nAmazon launched a new gift-giving feature that enables Prime members in the U.S. to use the Amazon mobile shopping app to send gifts with just the recipient’s email or mobile phone number. Recipients receive a gift message—by email or text—that allows them to accept the gift. They are then prompted to enter their preferred delivery address from their Amazon account to receive the gift.\n•\nAmazon’s Great Indian Festival sales event, which started on October 3, features more than 75,000 small businesses selling on Amazon from 450 cities across India, and provides customers access to a unique selection of products. The event also includes more than 1,000 new product launches from top brands like Apple, Maybelline, and Samsung.

The new store, formerly known as Souq.com, features millions of items from local and international brands across a range of categories, including apparel, electronics, grocery, home, and kitchen, as well as Amazon products and devices like Kindle e-readers.\n•\nPrime continued to expand and provide even more value to members around the world. The program is now available to customers in Sweden and Poland, offering free and fast delivery on millions of items. In the UK and Ireland, Prime members can now receive a free Deliveroo Plus membership for a year, giving them unlimited free delivery on orders over £25. In the U.S., Prime Student introduced new exclusive offers from Calm, Course Hero, Grubhub, and StudentUniverse offering exclusive discounts to college students. In Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Prime and Anghami, the Middle East and North Africa’s leading music streaming service, announced that Prime members can enjoy an exclusive six-month free offer on Anghami Plus, Anghami’s premium paid tier.\n•\nAmazon One, which lets customers use their palm to enter, identify, and pay at stores and other venues, was introduced for the first time at third-party locations. AXS, a leading digital ticketing company, integrated Amazon One into their contactless ticketing pedestals at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver. The technology was also introduced in four venues at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. Amazon One is now available at more than 70 Amazon physical retail stores and Whole Foods Market stores, and third-party locations.\n•\nFor the first time, Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology is being integrated into two new Whole Foods Market locations in Sherman Oaks, California and Washington, D.C. that are expected to open next year. In addition, three new third-party venues have been enabled with Just Walk Out technology: the Javits Center store in New York City, marking the first time Amazon’s checkout-free technology is being used in a convention center; the Forum store in Los Angeles, marking the first time a West Coast-based arena has enabled a store with Just Walk Out technology; and the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, marking the first time Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One have been used together in a third-party location.\n•\nAmazon is now the first and only marketplace to protect customers in third-party product liability cases. The company expanded its A-to-z Guarantee to protect customers in the rare case that a defective third-party product causes property damage or personal injury.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of October 28, 2021 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above.\nFourth Quarter 2021 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $130.0 billion and $140.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 12% compared with fourth quarter 2020.

Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is a new capability for Amazon ECS that enables customers to easily run, scale, secure, and manage container-based applications on-premises and at edge environments using the same APIs, cluster management, workload scheduling, monitoring, and deployment pipelines they use with Amazon ECS on AWS.\n•\nAWS announced the general availability of Amazon DevOps Guru, a fully managed operations service that uses machine learning to make it easier for developers to improve application availability by automatically detecting operational issues and recommending specific actions for remediation. Informed by years of Amazon.com and AWS operational excellence, Amazon DevOps Guru applies machine learning to automatically analyze data like application metrics, logs, events, and traces for behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns so developers can identify and remediate issues long before they impact customers.\n•\nAWS announced the general availability of Amazon Location Service, a new service that makes it easier and more cost-effective for customers to add location functionality to their applications, without compromising on user privacy or data security. With Amazon Location Service, customers can embed location functionality in their applications using data from location-based service providers Esri and HERE Technologies to provide maps, points of interest, geocoding (converting location information to a point on a map), route planning, geofencing (creating virtual perimeters), or asset tracking.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 29, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of July 29, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the third quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the third quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations.\nThird Quarter 2021 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $106.0 billion and $112.0 billion, or to grow between 10% and 16% compared with third quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 70 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $2.5 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $6.2 billion in third quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $1.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19.\n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing an outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $113-118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year.\nWhile we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate.\nWe currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\nWith the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years. There are several alternative ways of implementing the provisions of the Act, which we are currently evaluating. While we estimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our second quarter rate, we cannot quantify the magnitude at this time.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. For example, we continue to engage with the European Commission (EC) on our Less Personalized Ads offering (LPA), which we introduced in November 2024 based on feedback from the EC in connection with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). As the EC provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that it may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a materially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue, as early as later this quarter. We have appealed the EC's DMA decision but any modifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and Reality Labs efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 1, 2025, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 30, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $113-118 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $114-119 billion.\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64-72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $60-65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. The European Commission (EC) recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025. We will appeal the EC's DMA decision but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of the call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com, along with the company's earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward experiences that foster deeper connections and unlock new possibilities.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\n/\ninvestor.atmeta.com\nPress:\nAshley Zandy\npress@meta.com\n/\nmeta.com/news\n3\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and Reality Labs efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2025, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 30, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n42,314\n$\n36,455\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n7,572\n6,640\nResearch and development\n12,150\n9,978\nMarketing and sales\n2,757\n2,564\nGeneral and administrative\n2,280\n3,455\nTotal costs and expenses\n24,759\n22,637\nIncome from operations\n17,555\n13,818\nInterest and other income, net\n827\n365\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n18,382\n14,183\nProvision for income taxes\n1,738\n1,814\nNet income\n$\n16,644\n$\n12,369\nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n6.59\n$\n4.86\nDiluted\n$\n6.43\n$\n4.71\nWeighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share:\nBasic\n2,527\n2,545\nDiluted\n2,590\n2,625\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n28,750\n$\n43,889\nMarketable securities\n41,480\n33,926\nAccounts receivable, net\n14,514\n16,994\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n5,483\n5,236\nTotal current assets\n90,227\n100,045\nNon-marketable equity securities\n6,168\n6,070\nProperty and equipment, net\n133,567\n121,346\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n15,505\n14,922\nGoodwill\n20,654\n20,654\nOther assets\n14,092\n13,017\nTotal assets\n$\n280,213\n$\n276,054\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n8,512\n$\n7,687\nOperating lease liabilities, current\n1,976\n1,942\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n23,402\n23,967\nTotal current liabilities\n33,890\n33,596\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\n18,714\n18,292\nLong-term debt\n28,829\n28,826\nLong-term income taxes\n10,991\n9,987\nOther liabilities\n2,760\n2,716\nTotal liabilities\n95,184\n93,417\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital\n85,568\n83,228\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(1,865)\n(3,097)\nRetained earnings\n101,326\n102,506\nTotal stockholders' equity\n185,029\n182,637\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n280,213\n$\n276,054\n6\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2025\n2024\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet income\n$\n16,644\n$\n12,369\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,900\n3,374\nShare-based compensation\n4,147\n3,562\nDeferred income taxes\n(993)\n(456)\nOther\n(231)\n174\nChanges in assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable\n2,804\n2,520\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n360\n100\nOther assets\n(52)\n(94)\nAccounts payable\n(1,034)\n(1,112)\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n(2,231)\n(1,274)\nOther liabilities\n712\n83\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n24,026\n19,246\nCash flows from investing activities\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(12,941)\n(6,400)\nPurchases of marketable securities\n(11,763)\n(6,887)\nSales and maturities of marketable securities\n4,784\n4,625\nOther investing activities\n(90)\n(72)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(20,010)\n(8,734)\nCash flows from financing activities\nTaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards\n(4,883)\n(3,162)\nRepurchases of Class A common stock\n(12,754)\n(15,008)\nPayments for dividends and dividend equivalents\n(1,329)\n(1,273)\nPrincipal payments on finance leases\n(751)\n(315)\nOther financing activities\n222\n(9)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(19,495)\n(19,767)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents\n112\n(288)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents\n(15,367)\n(9,543)\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n45,438\n42,827\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents at end of the period\n$\n30,071\n$\n33,284\nReconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents to the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n28,750\n$\n32,307\nRestricted cash equivalents, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\n71\n84\nRestricted cash equivalents, included in other assets\n1,250\n893\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents\n$\n30,071\n$\n33,284\nSupplemental cash flow data\nCash paid for income taxes, net\n$\n448\n$\n630\n7\nSegment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 21% and 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\n•\nCosts and expenses\n– Total costs and expenses were $25.02 billion and $95.12 billion, representing increases of 5% and 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively. The fourth quarter costs and expenses included a favorable impact of $1.55 billion due to a decrease in the accrued losses for certain legal proceedings.\n•\nCapital expenditures\n– Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $14.84 billion and $39.23 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\n•\nCapital return program\n– Share repurchases of our Class A common stock were nil and $29.75 billion, and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.27 billion and $5.07 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\n•\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n– Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024. Free cash flow was $13.15 billion and $52.10 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\n•\nLong-term debt\n– Long-term debt was $28.83 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nHeadcount\n– Headcount\nwas 74,067 as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 10% year-over-year.\n1\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8 billion. This reflects 8-15% year-over-year growth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we are making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation\n(1)\n. We expect employee compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n____________________________________\n(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is January 29, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 30, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 31, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n39,071\n$\n31,999\n$\n75,527\n$\n60,645\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n7,308\n5,945\n13,948\n12,054\nResearch and development\n10,537\n9,344\n20,515\n18,725\nMarketing and sales\n2,721\n3,154\n5,285\n6,198\nGeneral and administrative\n(1)\n3,658\n4,164\n7,114\n7,049\nTotal costs and expenses\n24,224\n22,607\n46,862\n44,026\nIncome from operations\n14,847\n9,392\n28,665\n16,619\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n259\n(99)\n624\n(19)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n15,106\n9,293\n29,289\n16,600\nProvision for income taxes\n1,641\n1,505\n3,455\n3,102\nNet income\n$\n13,465\n$\n7,788\n$\n25,834\n$\n13,498\nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n5.31\n$\n3.03\n$\n10.17\n$\n5.24\nDiluted\n$\n5.16\n$\n2.98\n$\n9.86\n$\n5.18\nWeighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share:\nBasic\n2,534\n2,568\n2,540\n2,577\nDiluted\n2,610\n2,612\n2,619\n2,604\n____________________________________\n(1) The second quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses include a charge for the recent settlement with the State of Texas.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nQ1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:\n•\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.\n•\nSecond, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.\n•\nFinally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both\nAI and\nnon-\nAI\nhardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our\nartificial intelligence (AI) capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development.\nWhile we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the\nFederal Trade Commission\nis seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.\nThis was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities, and improved advertising performance for the businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our progress in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious, longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs.\n3\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 26, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 1, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 2% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nWe anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $87-89 billion, lowered from our prior range of $88-91 billion. This outlook includes approximately $3.5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.\nWe are also sharing a preliminary outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and our tax rate. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:\n•\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.\n•\nSecond, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will continue to shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.\n•\nFinally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe expect 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $27-29 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $27-30 billion.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-35 billion, with growth driven by investments in servers, including both non-artificial intelligence (AI) and AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with the new data center architecture we announced late last year.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2023 and full-year 2024 tax rates to be similar to the third quarter of 2023.\nPlease note that our outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates. In the future, we expect to provide our initial forward year expense, capital expenditures and tax rate outlooks on the fourth quarter call.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.\n3\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 27, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 25, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

These charges lowered our operating margin by\ntwo percentage points and three percentage points for the\nthree and six months\nended\nJune 30, 2023\n, respectively, and our diluted EPS by $0.25 and $0.61 for the\nthree and six months\nended\nJune 30, 2023\n, respectively.\n2\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect third quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $32-34.5 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 3% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $88-91 billion, increased from our prior range of $86-90 billion due to legal-related expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023. This outlook includes approximately $4 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.\nWhile we are not providing a quantitative outlook beyond 2023 at this point, we expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024 as we continue to invest in our most compelling opportunities, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.\n•\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.\n•\nSecond, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.\n•\nFinally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe expect our full-year 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $27-30 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $30-33 billion. The reduced forecast is due to both cost savings, particularly on non-AI servers, as well as shifts in capital expenditures into 2024 from delays in projects and equipment deliveries rather than a reduction in overall investment plans.\nLooking ahead, while we will continue to refine our plans as we progress throughout this year, we currently expect total capital expenditures to grow in 2024, driven by our investments across both data centers and servers, particularly in support of our AI work.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect the tax rate for the rest of the year to be similar to the second quarter of 2023.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape. With respect to EU-U.S. data transfers, we saw a positive development with the European Commission’s adoption of a final adequacy decision, which allows us to continue to provide our services in Europe. This is good news, though broadly speaking, we continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n3\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 27, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 26, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenue\n$\n31,999\n$\n28,822\n$\n60,645\n$\n56,729\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n5,945\n5,192\n12,054\n11,197\nResearch and development\n9,344\n8,690\n18,725\n16,397\nMarketing and sales\n3,154\n3,595\n6,198\n6,907\nGeneral and administrative\n(1)\n4,164\n2,987\n7,049\n5,347\nTotal costs and expenses\n22,607\n20,464\n44,026\n39,848\nIncome from operations\n9,392\n8,358\n16,619\n16,881\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n(99)\n(172)\n(19)\n213\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n9,293\n8,186\n16,600\n17,094\nProvision for income taxes\n1,505\n1,499\n3,102\n2,942\nNet income\n$\n7,788\n$\n6,687\n$\n13,498\n$\n14,152\nEarnings per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders:\nBasic\n$\n3.03\n$\n2.47\n$\n5.24\n$\n5.21\nDiluted\n$\n2.98\n$\n2.46\n$\n5.18\n$\n5.19\nWeighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders:\nBasic\n2,568\n2,704\n2,577\n2,714\nDiluted\n2,612\n2,713\n2,604\n2,729\n____________________________________\n(1) The second quarter 2023 general and administrative expenses include accrued legal expenses of $1.87 billion, which mostly relate to the fine imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commission in the ongoing data transfers matter and the adoption of new fining guidelines by the European Data Protection Board.

Substantially all employees impacted by the layoff announced in November 2022 are no longer reflected in our reported headcount as of March 31, 2023. Further, the employees that would be impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in our reported headcount as of\nMarch 31, 2023.\n1\nRestructuring\nIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of March 31, 2023, we have substantially completed the 2022 employee layoffs while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives. We incurred additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $621 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the\nFamily of Apps (\nFoA) and\nReality Labs\n(RL) segments. In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $1 billion, of which $523 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2023 and the remaining charges will be substantially recorded by the end of 2023.\nA summary of our restructuring charges for the\nthree months ended\nMarch 31, 2023\nby major activity type is as follows\n(in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023\nSeverance and Other Personnel Costs\n(1)\nFacilities Consolidation\nData Center\nAssets\n(2)\nTotal\nCost of revenue\n$\n—\n$\n58\n$\n(168)\n$\n(110)\nResearch and development\n320\n484\n—\n804\nMarketing and sales\n3\n136\n—\n139\nGeneral and administrative\n182\n129\n—\n$\n311\nTotal\n$\n505\n$\n807\n$\n(168)\n$\n1,144\n____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes severance and personnel costs of $523 million\nrelated to the 2023 layoffs and $18 million reduction in severance estimates related to the 2022 layoff.\n(2)    Relates to a change in estimates in our data center restructuring charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $934 million and RL segment were $210 million during the first quarter of 2023.\nExcluding these charges, our operating margin would have been four percentage points higher and our diluted EPS would have been $0.44 higher for\nthe first quarter of 2023\n.\n2\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect second quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $29.5-32 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency headwinds will be less than 1% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $86-90 billion, updated from our prior outlook provided in March. This outlook includes $3-5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.\nWe expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30-33 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. This outlook reflects our ongoing build out of AI capacity to support ads, Feed and Reels, along with an increased investment in capacity for our generative AI initiatives.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be around 20%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor ongoing regulatory developments. We expect the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to issue a decision in May in its previously disclosed inquiry relating to transatlantic data transfers of Facebook EU/EEA user data, including a suspension order for such transfers and a fine. Our ongoing consultations with policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic continue to indicate that the proposed new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework will be fully implemented before the deadline for suspension of such transfers, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it will not be completed in time. We will also evaluate whether and to what extent the IDPC decision could otherwise impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force.\n3\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments (including the impact of the pending decision by the IDPC and the pending EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework); risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 26, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

The goals of this work are: (1) to make us a better technology company and (2) to improve our financial performance in a difficult environment so we can execute our long term vision.\nOur efficiency work has several parallel workstreams to improve organizational efficiency, dramatically increase developer productivity and tooling, optimize distributed work, garbage collect unnecessary processes, and more. I've tried to be open about all the work that's underway, and while I know many of you are energized by this, I also recognize that the idea of upcoming org changes creates uncertainty and stress. My hope is to make these org changes as soon as possible in the year so we can get past this period of uncertainty and focus on the critical work ahead.\nHere's the timeline you should expect: over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. With less hiring, I’ve made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether they're impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May. In a small number of cases, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes. Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details. Overall, we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven't yet hired.\nThis will be tough and there's no way around that. It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have been part of our success. They've dedicated themselves to our mission and I'm personally grateful for all their efforts. We will support people in the same ways we have before and treat everyone with the gratitude they deserve.\nAfter restructuring, we plan to lift hiring and transfer freezes in each group. Other relevant efficiency timelines include targeting this summer to complete our analysis from our hybrid work year of learning so we can further refine our distributed work model. We also aim to have a steady stream of developer productivity enhancements and process improvements throughout the year.\nAs I've talked about efficiency this year, I've said that part of our work will involve removing jobs - and that will be in service of both building a leaner, more technical company and improving our business performance to enable our long term vision. I understand that this update may still feel surprising, so I'd like to lay out some broader context on our vision, our culture, and our operating philosophy.\nBuilding a Better Technology Company\nEvery day Meta builds new ways for people to feel closer. This is a fundamental human need that may be more important in today's complex world than ever. One day we hope to enable every person to feel as strong a sense of connection as you feel when you're physically with someone you love.\nWe do leading work across a wide range of advanced technologies and then distill that into inspiring products that improve people's lives. We do this with AI to help you creatively express yourself and discover new content, with the metaverse to deliver a realistic sense of presence, with new media formats to create richer experiences, with encryption to let you communicate privately in more and more ways, and with business tools to help reach customers, create opportunity and grow the economy.\nSimply put: if you want to invent the future or apply the best ideas to reach people at the greatest scale, then Meta is the best place to do that.\nWith that in mind, here are some of the cultural principles that are guiding our efficiency work towards making Meta an even stronger technology company:\nFlatter is faster\nIt's well-understood that every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making. Every manager typically reviews work and polishes off some rough edges before sending it further up the chain.\nIn our Year of Efficiency, we will make our organization flatter by removing multiple layers of management. As part of this, we will ask many managers to become individual contributors. We'll also have individual contributors report into almost every level - not just the bottom - so information flow between people doing the work and management will be faster.\nOf course, there are tradeoffs. We still believe managing each person is very important, so in general we don't want managers to have more than 10 direct reports. Today many of our managers have only a few direct reports. That made sense to optimize for ramping up new managers and maintaining buffer capacity when we were growing our organization faster, but now that we don't expect to grow headcount as quickly, it makes more sense to fully utilize each manager's capacity and defragment layers as much as possible.\nLeaner is better\nSince we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster. In retrospect, I underestimated the indirect costs of lower priority projects.\nIt's tempting to think that a project is net positive as long as it generates more value than its direct costs. But that project needs a leader, so maybe we take someone great from another team or maybe we take a great engineer and put them into a management role, which both diffuses talent and creates more management layers. That project team needs space, and maybe it tips its overall product group into splitting across multiple floors or multiple time zones, which now makes communication harder for everyone. That project team needs laptops and HR benefits and may want to recruit more engineers, so that leads us to hire even more IT, HR and recruiting people, and now those orgs grow and become less efficient and responsive to higher priority teams as well. Maybe the project has overlap with work on another team or maybe it built a bespoke technical system when it should have used general infrastructure we'd already built, so now it will take leadership focus to deduplicate that effort. Indirect costs compound and it's easy to underestimate them.\nA leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster. People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling.\nWe will become an even greater magnet for the most talented people. That's why in our Year of Efficiency, we are focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority and making every organization as lean as possible.\nKeep technology the main thing\nWe are a technology company, and our ultimate output is what we build for people. Everything else we do is in service of that.\nAs we've grown, we've hired many leading experts in areas outside engineering. This helps us build better products, but with many new teams it takes intentional focus to make sure our company remains primarily technologists.\nAs we add different groups, our product teams naturally hire more roles to handle all the interactions with those other groups. If we only rebalanced the product teams towards engineering, those leaner product teams would be overwhelmed by the volume of interactions from other groups.\nAs part of the Year of Efficiency, we're focusing on returning to a more optimal ratio of engineers to other roles. It's important for all groups to get leaner and more efficient to enable our technology groups to get as lean and efficient as possible. We will make sure we continue to meet all our critical and legal obligations as we find ways to operate more efficiently.\nInvest in tools to get more efficient\nWe're focused on the long term. That means investing in tools that will make us most effective over many years, not just this year - whether that's building AI tools to help engineers write better code faster, enabling us to automate workloads over time, or identifying obsolete processes that we can phase out.\nOur developer tooling work is underway and seeing good results. For example, Buck2 is our new open source build system that compiles builds around 50% faster so engineers can spend more time iterating and less time waiting. Our analysis found that engineers whose builds were sped up by Buck2 often produced meaningfully more code.\nIn-person time helps build relationships and get more done\nWe're committed to distributed work. That means we're also committed to continuously refining our model to make this work as effectively as possible.\nOur early analysis of performance data suggests that engineers who either joined Meta in-person and then transferred to remote or remained in-person performed better on average than people who joined remotely. This analysis also shows that engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week. This requires further study, but our hypothesis is that it is still easier to build trust in person and that those relationships help us work more effectively.\nAs part of our Year of Efficiency, we're focusing on understanding this further and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively. In the meantime, I encourage all of you to find more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person.\nImproving Business Performance in a Difficult Economic Environment\nIn addition to helping us build a better technology company, our other goal for the Year of Efficiency is to improve our business performance given the new economic reality. Profitability enables innovation. Operating our business more efficiently will give us the resources and confidence to achieve our long term vision by delivering sustainable financial results that make us an attractive company to work at and invest in.\nWhen I wrote my first letter to investors during our IPO, I described a basic principle that is still true today: \"we don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services.\"\nFor most of our history, we saw rapid revenue growth year-after-year and had the resources to invest in many new products. But last year was a humbling wake-up call. The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably. We scaled back budgets, shrunk our real estate footprint, and made the difficult decision to lay off 13% of our workforce.\nAt this point, I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years. Higher interest rates lead to the economy running leaner, more geopolitical instability leads to more volatility, and increased regulation leads to slower growth and increased costs of innovation. Given this outlook, we'll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.\nIn the face of this new reality, most companies will scale back their long term vision and investments. But we have the opportunity to be bolder and make decisions that other companies can't. So we put together a financial plan that enables us to invest heavily in the future while also delivering sustainable results as long as we run every team more efficiently. The changes we're making will enable us to meet this financial plan.\nI believe that we are working on some of the most transformative technology our industry has ever seen. Our single largest investment is in advancing AI and building it into every one of our products. We have the infrastructure to do this at unprecedented scale and I think the experiences it enables will be amazing. Our leading work building the metaverse and shaping the next generation of computing platforms also remains central to defining the future of social connection. And our apps are growing and continuing to connect almost half of the world's population in new ways. This work is incredibly important and the stakes are high. The financial plan we've set out puts us in position to deliver it.\nLooking Ahead\nI recognize that sharing plans for restructuring and layoffs months in advance creates a challenging period. But last fall, we heard feedback that you wanted more transparency sooner into any restructuring plans, so that's what I'm trying to provide here. I hope that giving you a timeline and principles for what to expect will help us get through the next couple of months and then move forward as we implement these changes that I believe will have a very positive impact on how we work.\nIn terms of how we should operate during this period, I encourage each of you to focus on what you can control. That is, do great work and support your teammates. Our community is extremely resilient. Change is never easy, but I know we'll get through this and come out an even stronger company that can build better products faster and enable you to do the best work of your careers.\nThis post contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations.

We also announced today a $40 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.\n•\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n– Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $40.74 billion as of December 31, 2022.\n•\nLong-term debt\n– Long-term debt was $9.92 billion as of December 31, 2022.\n•\nHeadcount\n– Headcount\nwas 86,482 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Our reported headcount includes\na substantial majority of the\napproximately\n11,000\nemployees impacted by the layoff we announced in November 2022, who\nwill no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n1\nRestructuring\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we took several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects.\nA summary of our restructuring charges during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nby major activity type is as follows\n(in millions):\nFacilities Consolidation\nSeverance and Other Personnel Costs\nData Center  Assets\nTotal\nCost of revenue\n$\n121\n$\n—\n$\n1,341\n$\n1,462\nResearch and development\n1,080\n408\n—\n1,488\nMarketing and sales\n330\n234\n—\n564\nGeneral and administrative\n351\n333\n—\n684\nTotal\n$\n1,882\n$\n975\n$\n1,341\n$\n4,198\nTotal restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $3.76 billion and RL segment were $440 million during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nExcluding these charges, our operating margin would have been 13 percentage points higher, our effective tax rate would have been one percentage point lower, and our diluted EPS would have been $1.24 higher for\nthe fourth quarter of 2022\n.\nThe impact of the severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 was not material after offsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses.\n2\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect first quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $26-28.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the first quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89-95 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $94-100\n_\nbillion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue. We now expect to record an estimated $1 billion in restructuring charges in 2023 related to consolidating our office facilities footprint. This is down from our prior estimate of $2 billion as we recorded a portion of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. We may incur additional restructuring charges as we progress further in our efficiency efforts.\nWe expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30-33 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $34-37 billion. The reduced outlook reflects our updated plans for lower data center construction spend in 2023 as we shift to a new data center architecture that is more cost efficient and can support both AI and non-AI workloads. Substantially all of our capital expenditures continue to support the Family of Apps.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2023 tax rate percentage to be in the low twenties.\nIn addition, as previously noted, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.\n3\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 27, 2022, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 1, 2023, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2022 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n5\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\nI want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted.\nHow did we get here?\nAt the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.\nIn this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We've shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas -- like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We've cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go.\nHow will this work?\nThere is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this.\nEveryone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions.\nSome of the details in the US include:\n•\nSeverance\n. We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.\n•\nPTO\n. We'll pay for all remaining PTO time.\n•\nRSU vesting\n. Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting.\n•\nHealth insurance\n. We'll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.\n•\nCareer services\n. We'll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.\n•\nImmigration support\n. I know this is especially difficult if you're here on a visa. There's a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need.\nOutside the US, support will be similar, and we'll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws.\nWe made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we're keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell.\nWhile we're making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we're planning to hire fewer people next year. We're also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days.\nThe teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I'm grateful for it. I'm sure you'll go on to do great work at other places.\nWhat other changes are we making?\nI view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we're transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We'll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months.\nWe're also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I'm going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently.\nI'm currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we're focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less.\nFundamentally, we're making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we're operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs.\nHow do we move forward?\nThis is a sad moment, and there's no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you've put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I'm grateful for your contributions.\nTo those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we've worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we're making these decisions to make sure our future is strong.\nI believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing.\nOur core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we're leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I'm confident that if we work efficiently, we'll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever.\nWe'll share more on how we'll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I'll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you've done to advance our mission.\nMark\nThis post contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 7% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nTo provide some context on the approach we are taking towards setting our 2023 budget, we are making significant changes across the board to operate more efficiently. We are holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities. As a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in-line with third quarter 2022 levels.\nWe have increased scrutiny on all areas of operating expenses. However, these moves follow a substantial investment cycle so they will take time to play out in terms of our overall expense trajectory. Some steps, like the ongoing rationalization of our office footprint, will lead to incremental costs in the near term. This should set us up well for future years, when we expect to return to higher rates of revenue growth.\nWe expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85-87 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $85-88 billion. This includes an estimated $900 million in additional charges related to consolidating our office facilities footprint that we expect to record in the fourth quarter of 2022. We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $96-101 billion. This includes an estimated $2 billion in charges related to consolidating our office facilities footprint.\nWe expect the slight majority of our 2023 expense dollar growth to be driven by operating expenses, with the remaining growth coming from cost of revenue. We expect the percentage growth rate of 2023 operating expenses to decelerate meaningfully as we curtail non-headcount related expense growth and keep 2023 headcount roughly flat with current levels. Conversely, our growth in cost of revenue is expected to accelerate, driven by infrastructure-related expenses and, to a lesser extent, Reality Labs hardware costs driven by the launch of our next generation of our consumer Quest headset later next year.\nReality Labs expenses are included in our total expense guidance. We do anticipate that Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year. Beyond 2023, we expect to pace Reality Labs investments such that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income in the long run.\nWe expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $32-33 billion, updated from our prior range of $30-34 billion. For 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $34-39 billion, driven by our investments in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. An increase in AI capacity is driving substantially all of our capital expenditure growth in 2023.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2022 and our full-year 2023 tax rate to be similar to the third quarter 2022 rate.\nIn addition, as previously noted, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 28, 2022, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October 26, 2022, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

As of June 30, 2022, we had $24.32 billion available and authorized for repurchases.\n•\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n– Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $40.49 billion as of June 30, 2022.\n•\nHeadcount\n– Headcount\nwas 83,553 as of June 30, 2022, an increase of 32% year-over-year.\n1\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect third quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $26-28.5 billion. This outlook reflects a continuation of the weak advertising demand environment we experienced throughout the second quarter, which we believe is being driven by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. We also anticipate third quarter Reality Labs revenue to be lower than second quarter revenue. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 6% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nIn addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.\nWe expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85-88 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $87-92 billion. We have reduced our hiring and overall expense growth plans this year to account for the more challenging operating environment while continuing to direct resources toward our company priorities.\nWe expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $30-34 billion, narrowed from our prior range of $29-34 billion.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be above the second quarter rate and in the high teens.\nChief Financial Officer Transition and Chief Strategy Officer Appointment\nEffective November 1, 2022, current Chief Financial Officer David Wehner will take on a new role as Meta's first Chief Strategy Officer, where he will oversee the company's strategy and corporate development. Susan Li, Meta's current Vice President of Finance, will be promoted and serve as Meta's Chief Financial Officer.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy and regulatory concerns; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 28, 2022, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 27, 2022, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

As of March 31, 2022, we had $29.41 billion available and authorized for repurchases.\n•\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n– Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $43.89 billion as of March 31, 2022.\n•\nHeadcount\n– Headcount\nwas 77,805 as of March 31, 2022, an increase of 28% year-over-year.\n1\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect second quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $28-30 billion. This outlook reflects a continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be approximately a 3% headwind to year-over-year growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates.\nIn addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations, and we are pleased with the progress on a political agreement.\nWe expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $87-92 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $90-95 billion. We expect 2022 expense growth to be driven primarily by the Family of Apps segment, followed by Reality Labs.\nWe expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $29-34 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate.\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be above the first quarter rate and in the high teens.\n2\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy and regulatory concerns; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage growth and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 3, 2022, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 27, 2022, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue\n. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\nWe subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n•\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q2 2025 increased 14%, or 13% in constant currency, year over year to $96.4 billion reflecting robust momentum across the business. Google Search & other, YouTube ads, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and Google Cloud each delivered double-digit growth in Q2.\n•\nGoogle Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion, reflecting strong performance across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and YouTube ads.\n•\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased 32% to $13.6 billion, led by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core GCP products, AI Infrastructure, and Generative AI Solutions.\n•\nTotal operating income increased 14% and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in the expense base, partially offset by a charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters.\n•\nNet income increased 19% and EPS increased 22% to $2.31.\nSundar Pichai, CEO, said: \"We had a standout quarter, with robust growth across the company. We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. Search delivered double-digit revenue growth, and our new features, like AI Overviews and AI Mode, are performing well. We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions offerings. And Cloud had strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run-rate is now more than $50 billion. With this strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services, we are increasing our investment in capital expenditures in 2025 to approximately $85 billion and are excited by the opportunity ahead.”\nQ2 2025 Financial Highlights\n(unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\nQuarter Ended June 30,\n2024\n2025\nRevenues\n$\n84,742\n$\n96,428\nChange in revenues year over year\n14\n%\n14\n%\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year\n(1)\n15\n%\n13\n%\nOperating income\n$\n27,425\n$\n31,271\nOperating margin\n32\n%\n32\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n126\n$\n2,662\nNet income\n$\n23,619\n$\n28,196\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.89\n$\n2.31\n(1)\nNon-GAAP measure.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025\n, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of\nJuly 23, 2025\n. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n7\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended June 30,\n2024\n2025\nInterest income\n$\n1,090\n$\n1,050\nInterest expense\n(67)\n(261)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(173)\n(69)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(310)\n165\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(714)\n1,286\nPerformance fees\n128\n(83)\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n32\n419\nOther\n140\n155\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n126\n$\n2,662\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q2 2025, the net effect of the gain on equity securities of $1.3 billion and the performance fees related to certain investments of $83 million increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted net income per share by $253 million, $950 million, and $0.08, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended\nTTM\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ2 2025\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n30,698\n$\n39,113\n$\n36,150\n$\n27,747\n$\n133,708\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(13,061)\n(14,276)\n(17,197)\n(22,446)\n(66,980)\nFree cash flow\n$\n17,637\n$\n24,837\n$\n18,953\n$\n5,301\n$\n66,728\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nTTM free cash flow:\nWe define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.\n8\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2025\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter Ended June

WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?\nTHE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY COUNSEL FOR THE SETTLING PARTIES. THE COURT HAS MADE NO FINDINGS WITH RESPECT\nTO SUCH MATTERS, AND THIS NOTICE IS NOT AN EXPRESSION OR STATEMENT BY THE COURT OF FINDINGS OF FACT.\n1\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\nA.\nFactual Background\n3. The Settlement arises out of the Action, which alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, among other claims, against certain officers and\ndirectors of the Company.\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs alleged in their Litigations that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by exposing the Company to antitrust investigations and enforcement\nactions by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, as well as other related civil litigation. Among other things,\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs alleged that Alphabet’s Board of Directors (the\n“\nBoard\n”) and certain Company’s senior executives and former executives, failed to properly oversee or caused the Company to pursue anticompetitive business practices, exposing the Company to the risk of liability under U.S.\nantitrust law in connection with the Company’s search, Ad Tech, and Android mobile operating system and app distribution businesses. Defendants deny all allegations made by the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs in the\nAction.\nB.\nThe Federal Litigation\n4. The Settlement arises out of the Action, which alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, among other claims, against certain officers and\ndirectors of the Company.\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs alleged in their Litigations that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by exposing the Company to antitrust investigations and enforcement\nactions by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, as well as other related civil litigation. Among other things,\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs alleged that Alphabet’s Board of Directors (the\n“\nBoard\n”) and certain Company’s senior executives and former executives, failed to properly oversee or caused the Company to pursue anticompetitive business practices, exposing the Company to the risk of liability under U.S.\nantitrust law in connection with the Company’s search, Ad Tech, and Android mobile operating system and app distribution businesses. Defendants deny all allegations made by the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs in the\nAction.\n5. On December 3, 2021, Plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit filed a shareholder derivative\naction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, against Defendants (\nPolice and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit v. Page\n, Case No.\n5:21-cv-09388).\nThe same day, Plaintiff Bucks County Employees’ Retirement System separately filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court against Defendants (\nBucks County Employees’\nRetirement System\nv. Page\n, Case No.\n5:21-cv-09389).\nPrior to filing suit, Plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and Plaintiff\nBucks County Employees’ Retirement System propounded shareholder inspection demands on Alphabet and had received productions of books and records from Alphabet. Relevant portions of those productions were included in Plaintiff Police and Fire\nRetirement System of the City of Detroit and Plaintiff Bucks County Employees’ Retirement System’s complaints, which were filed under seal.\n6. On December 6, 2021, Plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and Plaintiff Bucks County Employees’\nRetirement System filed a joint stipulation and proposed order with the Court to consolidate the\nPolice and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit\nand\nBucks County Employees’ Retirement System\nactions, appoint themselves as\nco-lead\nplaintiffs, and appoint Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP as lead counsel. On December 8, 2021, the Court ordered that the\nPolice and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit\nand\nBucks County Employees’ Retirement System\nactions be consolidated, appointed Plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and Plaintiff Bucks County Employees’ Retirement System as\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs, and appointed Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP as Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel. On December 16, 2021, the Court ordered a joint stipulation directing\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint.\n2\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\n7. On January 14, 2022,\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs\nfiled a consolidated complaint in the Litigation asserting five claims: (1) breach of fiduciary duty against the Individual Defendants in their capacity as directors; (2) breach of fiduciary duty against Defendants Brin, Page, Schmidt, and\nPichai in their capacity as officers; (3) breach of fiduciary duty against Defendants Brin, Page, and Schmidt in their capacity as controlling shareholders; (4) unjust enrichment; and (5) corporate waste (\nIn re Alphabet, Inc.\nShareholder Derivative Litigation\n, Case No.\n3:21-cv-09388-RLF,\nECF No. 32, the “\nConsolidated\nComplaint\n”).\n8. On April 15, 2022, the Settling Parties filed a stipulation and proposed order to temporarily stay the\nLitigation for six months, extendable by agreement of the Settling Parties, pending developments in the antitrust lawsuits underlying the allegations in the Consolidated Complaint. The Court granted the stay later on April 15, 2022. By\nagreement of the Settling Parties, the stay was extended to January 15, 2023. At the Court’s direction, the Settling Parties filed a Joint Status Report under seal on February 16, 2023.\n9. The Court then held a Case Management Conference on April 20, 2023, at which the Court continued the stay and ordered a further Case\nManagement Conference set for October 19, 2023. Following a joint stipulation by the Settling Parties, the Court continued the Case Management Conference to November 2, 2023. On November 2, 2023, the Court ordered a further Case\nManagement Conference on February 15, 2024.\n10. On November 27, 2023, the Litigation was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Rita\nF. Lin in the San Francisco Division. The Court vacated all case management conference dates. Pursuant to orders by the Court, the Settling Parties submitted Joint Case Management Statements on December 11, 2023, June 12, 2024, and\nDecember 12, 2024, each providing the Court an update on the underlying antitrust litigations involving Alphabet. The Court ordered continuations of the stay in the Litigation on December 26, 2023, June 12, 2024, and December 13,\n2024. On March 5, 2025, the Settling Parties filed a Stipulation and Proposed Order to continue the stay until May 30, 2025, which the Court ordered on March 6, 2025.\nC.\nThe State Action\n11. On June 16, 2022, Plaintiff Jamie Komen Revocable Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in Superior Court of the State of\nCalifornia, County of Santa Clara (\nJamie Komen Revocable Trust v. Page\n, Case No. 22CV399340, the “\nState Action\n” in the “\nState Court\n”) against the Individual Defendants, Does 1–25, and Alphabet. The State\nAction brought claims for: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) unjust enrichment; and (3) indemnification and contribution. On June 21, 2022, the State Court deemed the State Action a complex action and ordered a stay of discovery\nand responsive pleadings. The State Court set the initial Case Management Conference for October 27, 2022. Pursuant to stipulations by the parties to the State Action on October 13, 2022, January 19, 2023, May 4, 2023,\nNovember 6, 2023, December 8, 2023, March 18, 2024, April 12, 2024, June 20, 2024, September 6, 2024, December 3, 2024, January 31, 2025, and March 27, 2025, the State Court continued the initial Case\nManagement Conference in the State Action pending further developments in the underlying antitrust litigations involving Alphabet. On March 28, 2025, the State Court continued the initial Case Management Conference to June 12, 2025.\n3\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\nD.\nThe Mediations and Extensive Settlement Negotiations\n12. Prior to filing the\nPolice and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit\nand\nBucks\nCounty Employees’ Retirement\nSystem\nactions, Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel reviewed internal documents produced by Alphabet in response to\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs’ shareholder inspection demands. These documents included, among other\nthings,\n(1) non-privileged\nBoard materials relating to antitrust investigations or litigations involving Alphabet and the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General of Texas, Office of the\nAttorney General of Colorado, or U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary;\n(2) non-privileged\nBoard materials produced to the foregoing government entities in connection with any investigations of Alphabet\nfor allegations of anticompetitive conduct; and\n(3) non-privileged\nBoard materials relating to any U.S. civil litigation by nongovernmental litigants concerning antitrust or anticompetitive conduct\nallegations. On May 31, 2022, Alphabet further produced to\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs documents that were produced by Google to the Texas Attorney General in connection with that office’s investigation of\nGoogle’s business practices, consisting of 133,000 documents totaling 1,117,604 pages. These documents were produced to\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs under mediation privilege to assist in the evaluation of their\nclaims and the mediation process. On June 9, 2023, Alphabet produced transcripts of depositions and associated exhibits in certain underlying antitrust lawsuits to\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs for use in the\nongoing mediation process. On November 1, 2024, Alphabet further produced 52,818 pages of trial exhibits from the antitrust lawsuits underlying the allegations in the Consolidated Complaint.\n13. The Settling Parties have engaged in multiple\nin-person\nmediations under the guidance of the\nHonorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.), formerly the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The first\nfull-day\nmediation session occurred\nin-person\non December 15, 2022, and included participation by Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel, Defendants’ Counsel, and a representative from Alphabet. The Settling Parties and a representative from Alphabet\nparticipated in a second\nfull-day\nin-person\nmediation on February 7, 2024. The Settling Parties and a representative from Alphabet participated in a third\nfull-day\nin-person\nmediation on September 27, 2024, at which the Settling Parties engaged in further discussions of the merits of\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs’ claims and the Settling Parties’ proposals for corporate reforms.\n14. Throughout and following the\nin-person\nmediations, Judge Phillips continued to facilitate\ndiscussions between the Settling Parties, the merits of\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs’ claims, and the potential for settlement. Following extensive negotiations through Judge Phillips, the Settling Parties\nrequested the issuance of a mediator’s proposal concerning the amount of the proposed compliance spend commitment on February 28, 2025, which the Settling Parties accepted, subject to approvals, on March 5, 2025. The accepted\nmediator’s proposal included all substantive terms of the settlement, including the corporate reforms and compliance spend commitment by Alphabet. Following agreement on these terms, and with the assistance of Judge Phillips, the Settling\nParties agreed to the terms set out in Section V.1, which set out all substantive terms of the proposed settlement on March 13, 2025.\n15. After agreeing to all substantive terms of the proposed settlement, subject only to management/Board approval, Judge Phillips facilitated\nnegotiations between the Settling Parties concerning the amount of any Fee and Expense Award. The Settling Parties requested a mediator’s proposal concerning any Fee and Expense Award on March 25, 2025, which the Settling Parties accepted\non March 31, 2025. Following acceptance of the mediator’s proposal, the Settling Parties executed the Memorandum of Understanding on April 9, 2025.\n4\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\n16. The Settling Parties entered into the Stipulation on May 30, 2025. Prior to signing\nthe Stipulation, the Settling Parties had no negotiations regarding the amount of any Fee and Expense Awards or the amount of any Service Awards.\n17. On July 8, 2025, the Court entered the Preliminary Approval Order in connection with the Settlement which, among other things,\npreliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to current Alphabet stockholders, and scheduled the Settlement Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement.\nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT?\n18. In consideration of the Settlement and the releases provided therein, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Stipulation, the\nSettling Parties have agreed to the following Settlement Consideration for Alphabet.\n19.\nRegulatory Readiness Compliance\nEnhancements.\nAlphabet shall adopt and/or maintain (to the extent already implemented) the corporate governance and workplace measures and enhancements set forth in Paragraph 1.2 of the Stipulation.\n20.\nBoard Oversight Enhancements.\nThe Board shall create a new Risk and Compliance Committee (“RCC”) of the Board. The\nsubstantive terms of the RCC are described in Paragraph 1.4 of the Stipulation.\n21.\nManagement Oversight Enhancements.\nThe Company\nwill maintain a management to assist the RCC to oversee and monitor the Company’s compliance with regard to Google LLC (including its subsidiaries), as outlined in Paragraph 1.5 of the Stipulation. The Company will also maintain a management\nsteering committee to support the management council as described in Paragraph 1.5 of the Stipulation.\n22. To provide funding for its\ncross-company global compliance initiatives, Alphabet shall cause to be spent at least $500 million over the course of up to 10 years following the Effective Date of the Settlement on its global compliance efforts.\n23. The Company will also maintain the Google Chat policy, process, and/or technical capabilities described in Paragraph 1.7 of the\nStipulation.\nWHAT ARE THE SETTLING PARTIES’ REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT?\nE.\nWhy did the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs agree to settle?\n24. As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have reviewed and analyzed voluminous confidential,\nnon-public\ninternal documents. In addition, Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have reviewed and analyzed data from many other sources specific to this matter, including, but not limited to: (1) Alphabet’s\npublic filings with the SEC, press releases, announcements, transcripts of investor conference calls, and news articles; (2) securities analyst, business, and financial media reports about Alphabet; (3) internal Alphabet documents produced\npursuant to mediation privilege; (4) deposition\n5\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\ntranscripts and exhibits and trial exhibits in the underlying antitrust lawsuits produced pursuant to\nmediation privilege; and (5) trial transcripts and pleadings from the underlying antitrust lawsuits. Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have also (1) researched the applicable law with respect to the claims asserted (or which could be asserted)\nin the stockholder derivative actions and the potential defenses thereto; (2) researched, drafted, and filed complaints or sent inspection demands; (3) consulted with experts retained on numerous matters relevant to the pending litigation\nand settlement issues; (4) prepared detailed mediation statements; (5) reviewed documents and information provided in advance of the mediation sessions and during settlement negotiations; (6) participated in multiple\nin-person\nmediations; and (7) engaged in months-long settlement discussions with Defendants’ counsel.\n25. Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel believe that the claims asserted in the Litigation have merit and that their investigation of the evidence\nsupports the claims asserted. Without conceding the merit of any of the Defendants’ defenses, and in light of the benefits of the Settlement as well as to avoid the potentially protracted time, expense, and uncertainty associated with continued\nlitigation, including potential trial(s) and appeal(s),\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have concluded that it is desirable that the Litigation be fully and finally settled in the manner\nand upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel recognize the significant risk, expense, and length of continued proceedings necessary to\nprosecute the Litigation against Defendants through trial(s) and through possible appeal(s). Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially complex litigation such as the\nLitigation, the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation, the cost to Alphabet—on behalf of which\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs filed the Litigation—and distraction to management of Alphabet that\nwould result from extended litigation. Based on their evaluation, and in light of what Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel believe to be the significant benefits conferred upon Alphabet as a result of the Settlement,\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have determined that the Settlement is in the best interests of\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and Alphabet and have agreed to\nsettle the Litigation upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.\nF.\nWhy did the Settling Defendants and the Company agree to settle?\n26. Each Individual Defendant has denied and continues to deny that he or she has committed or attempted to commit any violations of law, any\nbreaches of fiduciary duty owed to Alphabet, or any wrongdoing whatsoever, and expressly maintains, that at all relevant times, he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Alphabet\nand its stockholders. Defendants further deny that the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs, Alphabet, or its stockholders suffered any damage or were harmed as a result of any act, omission, or conduct by the Individual\nDefendants as alleged in the Litigation or otherwise. Defendants further assert, among other things, that the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs lack standing to litigate derivatively on behalf of Alphabet because the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs have not yet pleaded, and cannot properly plead, that a demand on the Board would be futile.\n27. Alphabet nonetheless believes that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Company, its stockholders, and its employees. Defendants\nare, therefore, entering into this Settlement for its benefits and to eliminate the uncertainty, distraction, disruption, burden, risk, and expense of further litigation. Pursuant to the terms set forth below, this Stipulation (including the\nexhibits) shall not in any event be construed as, or deemed to be evidence of, an admission or concession by the Individual Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damage or any defect in the defenses that Individual\nDefendants have, or could have, asserted. Each Individual Defendant has further asserted, and continues to assert, that at all material times, the Individual Defendant acted in good faith and in a manner that she or he reasonably believed to be in\nthe best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders.\n6\nNOTICE OF PENDENCY AND\nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED?\nWHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE?\n28. If the Settlement is approved, the Court will enter a Judgment. Pursuant to the Judgment, the Action will be dismissed in its entirety and\nwith prejudice and, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement,\n1\nthe following releases will occur:\n29.\nRelease\nof\nClaims\nby\nCurrent\nAlphabet\nStockholders\n.

By Order of the Court, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and all other current Alphabet stockholders are barred and enjoined from asserting, commencing, instituting, or prosecuting any of the Released Stockholder Claims against any of the Released\nDefendant Persons.\n32.\nTHE\nABOVE\nDESCRIPTION\nOF\nTHE\nPROPOSED\nRELEASES\nIS\nONLY\nA\nSUMMARY.\nThe\ncomplete\nterms—including\nthe\ndefinitions\nof\nthe\nEffective\nDate,\nReleased Defendant\nClaims,\nReleased\nDefendant\nPersons,\nReleased\nStockholder\nClaims,\nReleased Stockholder\nPersons,\nand\nUnknown\nClaims—are\nset\nforth\nin\nthe\nStipulation\n, which is available on\nAlphabet’s investor relations website at\nhttps://abc.xyz/investor/\nand on Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel’s website at\nhttps://scott-scott.com/sdsettlements/alphabet-derivative-settlement/\n.\nHOW WILL THE STOCKHOLDERS’ ATTORNEYS BE PAID?\n33. Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel have not received any payment for their services in pursuing the claims asserted in the Action, nor have the\nPlaintiffs’ Lead Counsel been reimbursed for their litigation expenses. In light of benefits produced for Alphabet by the\nCo-Lead\nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel in connection with the\nSettlement, Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel intend to seek approval from the Court for a Fee and Expense Award not to exceed $80,000,000. The Fee and Expense Award is separate from and in addition to the $500 million spend amount.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024\n, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of\nApril 24, 2025\n. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow”and “Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2025\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n23,466\n$\n23,264\nMarketable securities\n72,191\n72,064\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n95,657\n95,328\nAccounts receivable, net\n52,340\n51,000\nOther current assets\n15,714\n15,724\nTotal current assets\n163,711\n162,052\nNon-marketable securities\n37,982\n51,029\nDeferred income taxes\n17,180\n18,386\nProperty and equipment, net\n171,036\n185,062\nOperating lease assets\n13,588\n13,722\nGoodwill\n31,885\n32,173\nOther non-current assets\n14,874\n12,950\nTotal assets\n$\n450,256\n$\n475,374\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n7,987\n$\n8,497\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n15,069\n9,984\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n51,228\n58,300\nAccrued revenue share\n9,802\n9,965\nDeferred revenue\n5,036\n4,908\nTotal current liabilities\n89,122\n91,654\nLong-term debt\n10,883\n10,886\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n8,782\n9,773\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,691\n11,678\nOther long-term liabilities\n4,694\n6,116\nTotal liabilities\n125,172\n130,107\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n7\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2024\n2025\nInterest income\n$\n1,061\n$\n1,001\nInterest expense\n(94)\n(34)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(238)\n(106)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(462)\n202\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n2,243\n9,758\nPerformance fees\n104\n(40)\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(26)\n(22)\nOther\n255\n424\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n2,843\n$\n11,183\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities.

Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended\nTTM\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nQ1 2025\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n26,640\n$\n30,698\n$\n39,113\n$\n36,150\n$\n132,601\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(13,186)\n(13,061)\n(14,276)\n(17,197)\n(57,720)\nFree cash flow\n$\n13,454\n$\n17,637\n$\n24,837\n$\n18,953\n$\n74,881\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nTTM free cash flow:\nWe define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.\n8\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024 to the Quarter Ended March 31, 2025\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2025\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter Ended

(March 18, 2025)—Google LLC today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, Inc., a leading cloud security platform headquartered in New York, for $32 billion, subject to closing adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. Once closed, Wiz will join Google Cloud.\nThis acquisition represents an investment by Google Cloud to accelerate two large and growing trends in the AI era: improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds (multicloud).\nBoth cybersecurity and cloud computing are rapidly growing industries with a vast range of solutions. The increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security.\nWiz delivers an easy-to-use security platform that connects to all major clouds and code environments to help prevent cybersecurity incidents. Organizations of all sizes — from start-ups and large enterprises to governments and public sector organizations — can use Wiz to protect everything they build and run in the cloud. Wiz is an innovative leader and continues to deliver new products with strong adoption, fueling rapid business growth, including over the last 12 months in which it has begun to deliver new categories of cybersecurity solutions.\nGoogle Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation. Bringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds. The combination of Google Cloud and Wiz will:\n•\nVastly improve how security is designed, operated and automated — providing an end-to-end security platform for customers, of all types and sizes, in the AI era;\n•\nScale cybersecurity teams by providing them an automated security platform;\n•\nLower customers’ cost of implementing and managing security controls;\n•\nProtect against new threats emerging due to the advancement of AI, prevent breaches, and help organizations respond to breaches much more efficiently; and\n•\nBoost the adoption of multicloud security and, as a result, customers’ ability to use multiple clouds; further spurring innovation in and the adoption of cloud computing.\nWiz’s products will continue to work and be available across all major clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud platforms, and will be offered to customers through an array of partner security solutions. Google Cloud will also continue to offer customers wide choice through a variety of partner security solutions available in the Google Cloud Marketplace.\nYou can read more technical details about Wiz’s solutions, and how they will work with Google Cloud, on the Google Cloud blog and Wiz blog.\nThe deal is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals.\nWebcast\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) will host a webcast to discuss this announcement on Tuesday, March 18, at 6:00am Pacific Time (9:00am Eastern Time). Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google and Alphabet; Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud; Assaf Rappaport, CEO, Wiz; and Anat Ashkenazi, CFO, Google and Alphabet, will discuss the transaction.\nThe webcast can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/live/8jY5YBSRVEU. A replay will be available for two weeks through the same link following the webcast.\nQuotes\nSundar Pichai, CEO, Google:\n“From its earliest days, Google’s strong security focus has made us a leader in keeping people safe online. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers. Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds.”\nThomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud: “\nGoogle Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry. Enabling more companies to prevent cyber attacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents.”\nAssaf Rappaport, Co-Founder & CEO, Wiz:\n\"Wiz and Google Cloud are fully committed to continue supporting and protecting customers across all major clouds, helping keep them safe and secure wherever they operate.

Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n7\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n1,110\n$\n1,088\nInterest expense\n(69)\n(53)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(449)\n(21)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(115)\n(431)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n586\n364\nPerformance fees\n(45)\n(43)\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(256)\n(87)\nOther\n(47)\n454\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n715\n$\n1,271\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q4 2024, the net effect of the\ngain on\nequity securities of\n$364 million\nand the performance fees related to certain investments\nof $43 million increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted net income per share by $67 million, $254 million, and $0.02, resp\nectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n39,113\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(14,276)\nFree cash flow\n$\n24,837\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n8\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2024\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter

All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of\nOctober 29, 2024\n. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2023\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n24,048\n$\n19,959\nMarketable securities\n86,868\n73,271\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n110,916\n93,230\nAccounts receivable, net\n47,964\n49,104\nOther current assets\n12,650\n15,207\nTotal current assets\n171,530\n157,541\nNon-marketable securities\n31,008\n36,177\nDeferred income taxes\n12,169\n15,915\nProperty and equipment, net\n134,345\n161,270\nOperating lease assets\n14,091\n13,561\nGoodwill\n29,198\n31,935\nOther non-current assets\n10,051\n13,867\nTotal assets\n$\n402,392\n$\n430,266\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n7,493\n$\n7,049\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n15,140\n12,908\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n46,168\n46,585\nAccrued revenue share\n8,876\n9,365\nDeferred revenue\n4,137\n4,896\nTotal current liabilities\n81,814\n80,803\nLong-term debt\n13,253\n12,297\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n911\n1,015\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n8,474\n8,219\nDeferred income taxes\n485\n706\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,460\n11,654\nOther long-term liabilities\n1,616\n1,453\nTotal liabilities\n119,013\n116,147\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n7\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2023\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n1,066\n$\n1,243\nInterest expense\n(116)\n(54)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(311)\n23\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(503)\n160\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(366)\n1,821\nPerformance fees\n179\n29\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(215)\n(107)\nOther\n120\n70\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(146)\n$\n3,185\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q3 2024, the net effect of the gain on equity securities of $1.8 billion and the $29 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $389 million, $1.5 billion, and $0.12, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n30,698\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(13,061)\nFree cash flow\n$\n17,637\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n8\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2024\n% Change from Prior

(September 24, 2024) – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced that it has received notice of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by Tutanota LLC to purchase up to 350,000 shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock at a price of $180 per share in cash. This offer to purchase up to 350,000 shares by Tutanota LLC represents less than 0.01 percent of the shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock outstanding as of the September 3, 2024 offer date, and is subject to numerous conditions.\nAlphabet does not endorse Tutanota LLC’s unsolicited mini-tender offer, and expresses no opinion on whether or not stockholders should tender their shares in response to Tutanota LLC’s offer. Alphabet is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota LLC, its mini-tender offer or its offer documentation.\nTutanota LLC has previously made a similar mini-tender offer for Alphabet shares, and has made similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws.\nAlphabet urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor and to exercise caution with respect to Tutanota LLC’s offer. Alphabet makes no recommendation on Tutanota LLC’s offer. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with Tutanota LLC’s offer documentation. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 7, 2024. Tutanota LLC may extend the offering period at its discretion.\nAlphabet encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at\nwww.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm\n.\nAlphabet requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions relating to Tutanota LLC’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Alphabet stock.\nAbout Alphabet Inc.\nAlphabet is a collection of companies, the largest of which is Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in September 1998 and the company is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif. Billions of people use its wide range of popular products and platforms each day, like Search, Ads, Chrome, Cloud, YouTube and Android.\nContact\nInvestor Relations:\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\nMedia:\npress@abc.xyz", "sublinks": [{"url": "https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm", "extracted_text": "Division of Market Regulation:\nLetter to the Securities Industry Association re: Broker-Dealer Mini-Tender Offer Dissemination and Disclosures\nJuly 24, 2001\nAgostino Ricci\nLewco Securities Corp.\nSIA Corporate Action Division\nMini-Tender Committee Chairperson\n34 Exchange Place\nJersey City, N.J. 07311\nRe: Broker-Dealer Mini-Tender Offer Dissemination and Disclosures\nDear Mr. Ricci:\nWe provide this letter in response to discussions with both the Securities Industry Association's legal staff and Corporate Action Division members concerning the role of broker-dealer firms in connection with mini-tender offer dissemination. In the past two and a half years, as mini-tender offers have become prevalent, issues have arisen concerning mini-tender offer information dissemination by broker-dealers. As you are aware, mini-tender offer bidders have often structured these offers to take advantage of security holders. For example, mini-tender offer bidders have (1) inadequately disseminated offering documents to security holders; (2) extended below market value offers; (3) made offers slightly above current market value but extended the offers past the initial expiration date until the market price rose above the tender price; (4) lowered the offering price by fees or distributions received after a particular date; (5) extended offers on a first come, first purchase basis without providing withdrawal rights; (6) extended offers without the financial ability to consummate the offers and structured offers so the bidder gained control of tendered securities without making payment; and (7) offered to exchange liquid securities for illiquid securities. These offers continue to victimize investors.\nBroker-dealers that hold customers' securities that are the subject of mini-tender offers have to decide whether to forward mini-tender offer information to such customers and what, if any, disclaimers should accompany this information. In this letter, we discuss our understanding of current broker-dealer practices and potentially problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices, and offer guidance for broker-dealers regarding their dissemination of mini-tender offer information.\nCurrent Broker-Dealer Practices\nWe are aware that broker-dealers employ a variety of practices to disseminate mini-tender offer information. Some broker-dealers review mini-tender offers prior to making a decision about whether to forward notice of the offers to customers. Some firms provide disclaimer language when they forward mini-tender offer information to customers. Other broker-dealers do not forward any mini-tender offers to customers. We do not suggest that broker-dealers should follow a uniform standard in this regard. Rather, our goal in this letter is to provide guidance for broker-dealers to consider when deciding whether and how to disseminate mini-tender offer information.\nProblematic Mini-Tender Offer Practices\nBroker-dealers should be alert to the following mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially victimize investors. A detailed discussion of many of these practices is contained in the interpretive release entitled, Commission Guidance on Mini-Tender Offers and Limited Partnership Tender Offers (the Release).1\nA. Inadequate Dissemination\nA bidder may violate Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) if the bidder does not make reasonable efforts to disseminate material information about the mini-tender offer to security holders. The Commission has stated that there are three methods of adequate dissemination: (1) publishing the mini-tender offering document in a newspaper; (2) publishing a summary of the offering in the newspaper and mailing the complete offering document to security holders; or (3) mailing the offering document to security holders using a security holder list.2 The Release states that it is not adequate bidder dissemination to forward the offering information to the Depository Trust Company or a brokerage firm or to post it on a web site.\nB. Inadequate Disclosure of Offer Price\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder is offering a premium for the targeted security when in fact the offer price may be below current market value. We recognize that there may be circumstances when acceptance of a mini-tender offer may be in a customer's interest because there is an illiquid market for that security. Limited partnership mini-tender offers may sometimes fall into this category. However, there have been numerous mini-tender offers for highly liquid securities that offer a price below current market value.\nBidders might set a mini-tender offer price at, or slightly above, the current market value. However, the bidder may extend the offer beyond the initial expiration date until such time as the market price rises above the mini-tender offer price. If this occurs, a security holder may lose control of his shares while the offer is extended because mini-tender offers generally do not provide withdrawal rights.\nBroker-dealers should be alert to mini-tender offers for securities in which trading is halted. The failure to include a current market price in the offering documents is a possible indication that trading is halted. NASD Rule 3340 prohibits effecting transactions in halted securities.3\nC. Price Changes\nOften, a bidder will specify a mini-tender offer price but provide that transfer fees, distributions, or interest received after a certain date may reduce the mini-tender offer price. Therefore, even if the stated offer price is above the current market value, some customers may not fully appreciate that the actual offer price that will be received, once distributions or other amounts are deducted, may be below the current market value. Also, the market price of a security may rise or decline after the bidder disseminates the offer.\nD. First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\nThe first come, first purchase terms may pressure customers to make hasty, uninformed tender decisions. The failure to provide withdrawal rights leaves shareholders without a means to reconsider their decisions to tender. Moreover, the lack of withdrawal rights means that shareholders lose control of their securities for the duration of the mini-tender offer, including potentially lengthy periods if the mini-tender offer is extended.\nE. Inability to Finance the Offer\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder has the ability to pay for an offer and that the bidder will gain control of tendered shares only if the bidder pays for the shares. However, a bidder may extend a mini-tender offer when he does not have the ability to pay for the shares. The bidder may also structure the offer without using an escrow account or independent receiving agent in order to gain control of the shares before making payment.4 If a mini-tender offer bidder structures an offer so that tendered shares are routed to the bidder's account prior to the bidder making payment, customers may risk tendering their shares without receiving payment.\nF. Exchange Offers for Privately Held Companies\nA mini-tender offer bidder may offer to purchase publicly traded, liquid securities in exchange for the securities of privately held corporations for which there is no public market. Investors may not be adequately informed that by participating in such an exchange offer, they will receive an illiquid security.\nBroker-Dealer Dissemination of Mini-Tender Offer Information\nThere is no Exchange Act rule that specifically addresses the practice of broker-dealers forwarding mini-tender offer information to their customers. Thus, there is no requirement under the Exchange Act mandating that a broker-dealer forward mini-tender offer information to its customers.5\nWe support the position set forth in NYSE Information Memo 99-11 that it is a prudent practice for broker-dealers to review a mini-tender offer when making a decision about whether to forward mini-tender offer information. In that process, we suggest broker-dealers consider the problematic bidder practices mentioned above.\nBest Practice Guidance\nA broker-dealer's principal means for forwarding to customers information about tender offers is the mailing of a notice on the brokerage firm's letterhead. We believe that it is consistent with achieving a high level of investor protection for the broker-dealer to inform its customers of potentially problematic bidder practices. Broker-dealers may perform a disservice to customers if they forward mini-tender offer information to customers without providing information in their notices regarding problematic bidder practices.\nWithout adequate information, a customer may assume that a mini-tender offer has the same procedural protections that a traditional tender offer provides and that the mini-tender offer price is at a premium above market price. Moreover, customers might assume that a broker-dealer is endorsing a mini-tender offer because the notice is on the firm's letterhead. This concern is heightened if the broker-dealer's notice encourages participation in a mini-tender offer. For example, a statement in a broker-dealer's notice may encourage participation in a mini-tender offer if it instructs customers to act quickly or risk losing a valuable investment opportunity, or if it states that failure to respond to the offer may result in adverse financial consequences.\nSome broker-dealers provide information in their notices concerning mini-tender bidder practices. Some notices provide better information than others regarding potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. Other broker-dealers' notices may not provide any information about bidder practices. Accordingly, we suggest as a best practice that broker-dealers provide customers with information about problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices whenever they forward mini-tender offer information to their customers.6 Specifically, we suggest using the information delineated below to alert customers of potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices.\nMini-Tender Offer Information7\n- Definition\n- Mini-tender offers are offers for less than five percent of a company's equity securities that are not subject to the disclosure and procedural rules that apply to other types of tender offers.\n- Offer Price\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may be offering you a price for your securities that is less than the current market value of your securities. You should check the current market price of your security to help you decide whether this is an offer that you should accept.\n- A mini-tender offer with an above-market value tender price may be extended beyond the initial expiration date. In such a case, the market price may rise above the tender price while the offer is extended. If this occurs, you may tender at a price below what you would have received if you sold your shares in the market. Compare the price you would receive if you tender and the price that you would receive if you sell your shares through your broker-dealer.\n- Price Changes\n- In some mini-tender offers, you may get a lower price than indicated in the offer because deductions are taken from the price for dividend payments, distributions, or other fees. You should determine the \"final\" tender payment after all deductions are taken before you tender.\n- First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\n- A mini-tender offer may be structured on a first come, first purchase basis, which means that the person making the offer accepts shares in order of receipt. This may place pressure on you to quickly tender your shares in order to be accepted into the mini-tender offer without having solid information about the offer and the person making the offer. Be sure that you understand the terms of a mini-tender offer before tendering your shares. You should obtain a copy of the offering document and read it carefully.\n- A mini-tender offer may not provide withdrawal rights, which means that you are locked into the mini-tender offer once you offer to tender your shares. You cannot change your mind after you tender your shares, even if the offer has not closed. In addition, the bidder can extend the mini-tender offer without giving you the right to withdraw your shares. In the meantime, you lose control over your securities and you may not have received payment.\n- Ability to Finance the Offer\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may receive your tendered shares before he pays you for your shares. Additionally, the person making the mini-tender offer might not have the funds to pay you at all. You could lose your shares without ever being paid. Alternatively, even if you are paid for tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer, the person making the offer could delay making the payment for weeks or months.\n- Exchange Offers\n- You may be asked to tender a security that is publicly traded on an exchange or over-the-counter and in return you will receive a security that is not publicly traded. As such, you may receive shares through a mini-tender offer that you cannot easily sell.\n- Additional Information\n- The target company is required to state its position about the offer by recommending that investors accept or reject the offer.\n- Persons considering the offer should consult with a financial advisor.\n- Compare all your alternatives for selling your securities before tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer.\n- You may obtain additional information about mini-tender offers by visiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.\nThis information could be conveyed in various formats. It could be added to a broker-dealer's current notice. We are aware, however, that broker-dealers may have systems limitations in the way that they include information in their notices. Therefore, we suggest two alternative means of conveying the information if it is used in the notice. First, the information could be used with only the mini-tender offer notices that a broker-dealer sends to customers. However, some firms' systems may not distinguish between mini-tender offers and other tender offers. Instead, their systems generate the same notice for all tender offers, including mini-tender offers. If this is the case, the notice could dedicate a section to mini-tender offers. In order to avoid customer confusion, firms could clearly indicate in the notice that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers and customers can refer to the notice's definition of a mini-tender offer and contact their financial advisor to determine whether the offer is a mini-tender offer.\nAs an alternative, a broker-dealer could mail the Commission's publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors (a copy of which is attached), with its notice rather than incorporating the information delineated above into the notice. This insert could be mailed only with mini-tender offer notices or with all tender offer and mini-tender offer notices that the broker-dealer forwards to customers. If the mailing is done with all tender offers, it would be helpful for firms to indicate that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers. In order to determine if an offer is a mini-tender offer, customers can refer to the publication and contact their financial advisor.\nIf an on-line broker-dealer sends its tender offer notices to customers via e-mail rather than sending the notice through the mail, that firm could incorporate the above information into its e-mail notice. In addition, on-line broker-dealers could also provide the information again at the time a customer enters tender instructions on-line. It could do so by hyperlinking to the Commission's on-line publication regarding mini-tender offers.\nOf course, brokerage firms may formulate their own version of this information. However, we believe that this information describes the types of mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially disadvantage customers. Brokerage firms might add supplementary information as warranted by mini-tender bidder practices.\nAdditionally, broker-dealers might also publish information on their websites regarding mini-tender offers and potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. The website page could incorporate statements from the above-suggested information and be modeled after the mini-tender notice published on the Commission's website. A broker-dealer's website publication should not be employed as an alternative to incorporating the above information into its notice or mailing an insert to customers because it is likely that not all of the target shareholder customers have access to the Internet or will be aware that this important information is on the broker-dealer's website. Brokerage firms could also hyperlink their websites to the Commission's on-line publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors.\nWe believe that broker-dealers and investors should be alert to the problematic features of some mini-tender offers. We encourage broker-dealers to consider the recommendations in this letter when forwarding mini-tender offer information to customers. We believe that it will assist investors in making better-informed decisions about mini-tender offers.\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact James Brigagliano, Assistant Director, or Elizabeth Sandoe, Attorney, in the Office of Trading Practices, Division of Market Regulation at (202) 942-0772.\nSincerely,\nAnnette L.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024\n, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of\nJuly 23, 2024\n. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\n2023\nAs of June 30,\n2024\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n24,048\n$\n27,225\nMarketable securities\n86,868\n73,500\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n110,916\n100,725\nAccounts receivable, net\n47,964\n47,087\nOther current assets\n12,650\n14,183\nTotal current assets\n171,530\n161,995\nNon-marketable securities\n31,008\n34,172\nDeferred income taxes\n12,169\n14,958\nProperty and equipment, net\n134,345\n151,155\nOperating lease assets\n14,091\n13,606\nGoodwill\n29,198\n29,185\nOther non-current assets\n10,051\n9,699\nTotal assets\n$\n402,392\n$\n414,770\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n7,493\n$\n6,092\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n15,140\n11,373\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n46,168\n47,298\nAccrued revenue share\n8,876\n8,899\nDeferred revenue\n4,137\n4,251\nTotal current liabilities\n81,814\n77,913\nLong-term debt\n13,253\n13,238\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n911\n985\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n8,474\n7,703\nDeferred income taxes\n485\n717\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,460\n11,708\nOther long-term liabilities\n1,616\n1,753\nTotal liabilities\n119,013\n114,017\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and employee severance in 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n7\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended June 30,\n2023\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n892\n$\n1,090\nInterest expense\n(43)\n(67)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(268)\n(173)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(304)\n(310)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(205)\n(714)\nPerformance fees\n5\n128\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(106)\n32\nOther\n94\n140\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n65\n$\n126\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q2 2024, the net effect of the loss on equity securities of $714 million and the $128 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $123 million, $463 million, and $0.04, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n26,640\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(13,186)\nFree cash flow\n$\n13,454\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n8\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter Ended June

(June 26, 2024) – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced that it has received notice of an unsolicited\nmini-tender offer by Tutanota LLC to purchase up to 400,000 shares of Alphabet’s Class A common stock at a price of $180 per share in cash. This offer to purchase up to 400,000 shares by Tutanota LLC represents less than 0.01 percent\nof the shares of Alphabet’s Class A common stock outstanding as of the June 10, 2024 offer date.\nAlphabet does not endorse Tutanota\nLLC’s unsolicited mini-tender offer, and expresses no opinion on whether or not stockholders should tender their shares in response to Tutanota LLC’s offer. Alphabet is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota LLC, its\nmini-tender offer or its offer documentation.\nTutanota LLC’s has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender\noffers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than\n5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws.\nAlphabet urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor and to exercise caution with\nrespect to Tutanota LLC’s offer. Alphabet makes no recommendation on Tutanota LLC’s offer. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with Tutanota\nLLC’s offer documentation. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 12, 2024. Tutanota LLC may extend the offering period at its discretion.\n5\nAlphabet encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s\nletter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at\nwww.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm\n.\nAlphabet requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions relating to Tutanota LLC’s mini-tender offer related to shares of\nAlphabet stock.\nAbout Alphabet Inc.\nAlphabet is a\ncollection of companies, the largest of which is Google.

In the past two and a half years, as mini-tender offers have become prevalent, issues have arisen concerning mini-tender offer information dissemination by broker-dealers. As you are aware, mini-tender offer bidders have often structured these offers to take advantage of security holders. For example, mini-tender offer bidders have (1) inadequately disseminated offering documents to security holders; (2) extended below market value offers; (3) made offers slightly above current market value but extended the offers past the initial expiration date until the market price rose above the tender price; (4) lowered the offering price by fees or distributions received after a particular date; (5) extended offers on a first come, first purchase basis without providing withdrawal rights; (6) extended offers without the financial ability to consummate the offers and structured offers so the bidder gained control of tendered securities without making payment; and (7) offered to exchange liquid securities for illiquid securities. These offers continue to victimize investors.\nBroker-dealers that hold customers' securities that are the subject of mini-tender offers have to decide whether to forward mini-tender offer information to such customers and what, if any, disclaimers should accompany this information. In this letter, we discuss our understanding of current broker-dealer practices and potentially problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices, and offer guidance for broker-dealers regarding their dissemination of mini-tender offer information.\nCurrent Broker-Dealer Practices\nWe are aware that broker-dealers employ a variety of practices to disseminate mini-tender offer information. Some broker-dealers review mini-tender offers prior to making a decision about whether to forward notice of the offers to customers. Some firms provide disclaimer language when they forward mini-tender offer information to customers. Other broker-dealers do not forward any mini-tender offers to customers. We do not suggest that broker-dealers should follow a uniform standard in this regard. Rather, our goal in this letter is to provide guidance for broker-dealers to consider when deciding whether and how to disseminate mini-tender offer information.\nProblematic Mini-Tender Offer Practices\nBroker-dealers should be alert to the following mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially victimize investors. A detailed discussion of many of these practices is contained in the interpretive release entitled, Commission Guidance on Mini-Tender Offers and Limited Partnership Tender Offers (the Release).1\nA. Inadequate Dissemination\nA bidder may violate Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) if the bidder does not make reasonable efforts to disseminate material information about the mini-tender offer to security holders. The Commission has stated that there are three methods of adequate dissemination: (1) publishing the mini-tender offering document in a newspaper; (2) publishing a summary of the offering in the newspaper and mailing the complete offering document to security holders; or (3) mailing the offering document to security holders using a security holder list.2 The Release states that it is not adequate bidder dissemination to forward the offering information to the Depository Trust Company or a brokerage firm or to post it on a web site.\nB. Inadequate Disclosure of Offer Price\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder is offering a premium for the targeted security when in fact the offer price may be below current market value. We recognize that there may be circumstances when acceptance of a mini-tender offer may be in a customer's interest because there is an illiquid market for that security. Limited partnership mini-tender offers may sometimes fall into this category. However, there have been numerous mini-tender offers for highly liquid securities that offer a price below current market value.\nBidders might set a mini-tender offer price at, or slightly above, the current market value. However, the bidder may extend the offer beyond the initial expiration date until such time as the market price rises above the mini-tender offer price. If this occurs, a security holder may lose control of his shares while the offer is extended because mini-tender offers generally do not provide withdrawal rights.\nBroker-dealers should be alert to mini-tender offers for securities in which trading is halted. The failure to include a current market price in the offering documents is a possible indication that trading is halted. NASD Rule 3340 prohibits effecting transactions in halted securities.3\nC. Price Changes\nOften, a bidder will specify a mini-tender offer price but provide that transfer fees, distributions, or interest received after a certain date may reduce the mini-tender offer price. Therefore, even if the stated offer price is above the current market value, some customers may not fully appreciate that the actual offer price that will be received, once distributions or other amounts are deducted, may be below the current market value. Also, the market price of a security may rise or decline after the bidder disseminates the offer.\nD. First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\nThe first come, first purchase terms may pressure customers to make hasty, uninformed tender decisions. The failure to provide withdrawal rights leaves shareholders without a means to reconsider their decisions to tender. Moreover, the lack of withdrawal rights means that shareholders lose control of their securities for the duration of the mini-tender offer, including potentially lengthy periods if the mini-tender offer is extended.\nE. Inability to Finance the Offer\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder has the ability to pay for an offer and that the bidder will gain control of tendered shares only if the bidder pays for the shares. However, a bidder may extend a mini-tender offer when he does not have the ability to pay for the shares. The bidder may also structure the offer without using an escrow account or independent receiving agent in order to gain control of the shares before making payment.4 If a mini-tender offer bidder structures an offer so that tendered shares are routed to the bidder's account prior to the bidder making payment, customers may risk tendering their shares without receiving payment.\nF. Exchange Offers for Privately Held Companies\nA mini-tender offer bidder may offer to purchase publicly traded, liquid securities in exchange for the securities of privately held corporations for which there is no public market. Investors may not be adequately informed that by participating in such an exchange offer, they will receive an illiquid security.\nBroker-Dealer Dissemination of Mini-Tender Offer Information\nThere is no Exchange Act rule that specifically addresses the practice of broker-dealers forwarding mini-tender offer information to their customers. Thus, there is no requirement under the Exchange Act mandating that a broker-dealer forward mini-tender offer information to its customers.5\nWe support the position set forth in NYSE Information Memo 99-11 that it is a prudent practice for broker-dealers to review a mini-tender offer when making a decision about whether to forward mini-tender offer information. In that process, we suggest broker-dealers consider the problematic bidder practices mentioned above.\nBest Practice Guidance\nA broker-dealer's principal means for forwarding to customers information about tender offers is the mailing of a notice on the brokerage firm's letterhead. We believe that it is consistent with achieving a high level of investor protection for the broker-dealer to inform its customers of potentially problematic bidder practices. Broker-dealers may perform a disservice to customers if they forward mini-tender offer information to customers without providing information in their notices regarding problematic bidder practices.\nWithout adequate information, a customer may assume that a mini-tender offer has the same procedural protections that a traditional tender offer provides and that the mini-tender offer price is at a premium above market price. Moreover, customers might assume that a broker-dealer is endorsing a mini-tender offer because the notice is on the firm's letterhead. This concern is heightened if the broker-dealer's notice encourages participation in a mini-tender offer. For example, a statement in a broker-dealer's notice may encourage participation in a mini-tender offer if it instructs customers to act quickly or risk losing a valuable investment opportunity, or if it states that failure to respond to the offer may result in adverse financial consequences.\nSome broker-dealers provide information in their notices concerning mini-tender bidder practices. Some notices provide better information than others regarding potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. Other broker-dealers' notices may not provide any information about bidder practices. Accordingly, we suggest as a best practice that broker-dealers provide customers with information about problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices whenever they forward mini-tender offer information to their customers.6 Specifically, we suggest using the information delineated below to alert customers of potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices.\nMini-Tender Offer Information7\n- Definition\n- Mini-tender offers are offers for less than five percent of a company's equity securities that are not subject to the disclosure and procedural rules that apply to other types of tender offers.\n- Offer Price\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may be offering you a price for your securities that is less than the current market value of your securities. You should check the current market price of your security to help you decide whether this is an offer that you should accept.\n- A mini-tender offer with an above-market value tender price may be extended beyond the initial expiration date. In such a case, the market price may rise above the tender price while the offer is extended. If this occurs, you may tender at a price below what you would have received if you sold your shares in the market. Compare the price you would receive if you tender and the price that you would receive if you sell your shares through your broker-dealer.\n- Price Changes\n- In some mini-tender offers, you may get a lower price than indicated in the offer because deductions are taken from the price for dividend payments, distributions, or other fees. You should determine the \"final\" tender payment after all deductions are taken before you tender.\n- First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\n- A mini-tender offer may be structured on a first come, first purchase basis, which means that the person making the offer accepts shares in order of receipt. This may place pressure on you to quickly tender your shares in order to be accepted into the mini-tender offer without having solid information about the offer and the person making the offer. Be sure that you understand the terms of a mini-tender offer before tendering your shares. You should obtain a copy of the offering document and read it carefully.\n- A mini-tender offer may not provide withdrawal rights, which means that you are locked into the mini-tender offer once you offer to tender your shares. You cannot change your mind after you tender your shares, even if the offer has not closed. In addition, the bidder can extend the mini-tender offer without giving you the right to withdraw your shares. In the meantime, you lose control over your securities and you may not have received payment.\n- Ability to Finance the Offer\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may receive your tendered shares before he pays you for your shares. Additionally, the person making the mini-tender offer might not have the funds to pay you at all. You could lose your shares without ever being paid. Alternatively, even if you are paid for tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer, the person making the offer could delay making the payment for weeks or months.\n- Exchange Offers\n- You may be asked to tender a security that is publicly traded on an exchange or over-the-counter and in return you will receive a security that is not publicly traded. As such, you may receive shares through a mini-tender offer that you cannot easily sell.\n- Additional Information\n- The target company is required to state its position about the offer by recommending that investors accept or reject the offer.\n- Persons considering the offer should consult with a financial advisor.\n- Compare all your alternatives for selling your securities before tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer.\n- You may obtain additional information about mini-tender offers by visiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.\nThis information could be conveyed in various formats. It could be added to a broker-dealer's current notice. We are aware, however, that broker-dealers may have systems limitations in the way that they include information in their notices. Therefore, we suggest two alternative means of conveying the information if it is used in the notice. First, the information could be used with only the mini-tender offer notices that a broker-dealer sends to customers. However, some firms' systems may not distinguish between mini-tender offers and other tender offers. Instead, their systems generate the same notice for all tender offers, including mini-tender offers. If this is the case, the notice could dedicate a section to mini-tender offers. In order to avoid customer confusion, firms could clearly indicate in the notice that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers and customers can refer to the notice's definition of a mini-tender offer and contact their financial advisor to determine whether the offer is a mini-tender offer.\nAs an alternative, a broker-dealer could mail the Commission's publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors (a copy of which is attached), with its notice rather than incorporating the information delineated above into the notice. This insert could be mailed only with mini-tender offer notices or with all tender offer and mini-tender offer notices that the broker-dealer forwards to customers. If the mailing is done with all tender offers, it would be helpful for firms to indicate that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers. In order to determine if an offer is a mini-tender offer, customers can refer to the publication and contact their financial advisor.\nIf an on-line broker-dealer sends its tender offer notices to customers via e-mail rather than sending the notice through the mail, that firm could incorporate the above information into its e-mail notice. In addition, on-line broker-dealers could also provide the information again at the time a customer enters tender instructions on-line. It could do so by hyperlinking to the Commission's on-line publication regarding mini-tender offers.\nOf course, brokerage firms may formulate their own version of this information. However, we believe that this information describes the types of mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially disadvantage customers. Brokerage firms might add supplementary information as warranted by mini-tender bidder practices.\nAdditionally, broker-dealers might also publish information on their websites regarding mini-tender offers and potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. The website page could incorporate statements from the above-suggested information and be modeled after the mini-tender notice published on the Commission's website. A broker-dealer's website publication should not be employed as an alternative to incorporating the above information into its notice or mailing an insert to customers because it is likely that not all of the target shareholder customers have access to the Internet or will be aware that this important information is on the broker-dealer's website. Brokerage firms could also hyperlink their websites to the Commission's on-line publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors.\nWe believe that broker-dealers and investors should be alert to the problematic features of some mini-tender offers. We encourage broker-dealers to consider the recommendations in this letter when forwarding mini-tender offer information to customers. We believe that it will assist investors in making better-informed decisions about mini-tender offers.\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact James Brigagliano, Assistant Director, or Elizabeth Sandoe, Attorney, in the Office of Trading Practices, Division of Market Regulation at (202) 942-0772.\nSincerely,\nAnnette L.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 25, 2024. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues, and other cost of sales, operating expenses, and operating margin, excluding the effect of severance and related and office space charges. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\n3\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow”, “Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” and “Reconciliation from Certain GAAP Measures to Certain Non-GAAP Measures, Excluding the Effect of Severance and Related and Office Space Charges” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n4\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAs of March 31, 2024\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n24,048\n$\n24,493\nMarketable securities\n86,868\n83,597\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n110,916\n108,090\nAccounts receivable, net\n47,964\n44,552\nOther current assets\n12,650\n12,829\nTotal current assets\n171,530\n165,471\nNon-marketable securities\n31,008\n33,994\nDeferred income taxes\n12,169\n11,687\nProperty and equipment, net\n134,345\n143,182\nOperating lease assets\n14,091\n13,768\nGoodwill\n29,198\n29,183\nOther non-current assets\n10,051\n10,065\nTotal assets\n$\n402,392\n$\n407,350\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n7,493\n$\n6,198\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n15,140\n9,703\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n46,168\n48,603\nAccrued revenue share\n8,876\n8,520\nDeferred revenue\n4,137\n3,973\nTotal current liabilities\n81,814\n76,997\nLong-term debt\n13,253\n13,228\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n911\n921\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n8,474\n9,234\nDeferred income taxes\n485\n486\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,460\n11,957\nOther long-term liabilities\n1,616\n1,683\nTotal liabilities\n119,013\n114,506\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n8\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2023\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n797\n$\n1,061\nInterest expense\n(80)\n(94)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(210)\n(238)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(293)\n(462)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n377\n2,243\nPerformance fees\n118\n104\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(51)\n(26)\nOther\n132\n255\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n790\n$\n2,843\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities.

(February 8, 2024) – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced that it has received notice of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation of Ontario, Canada to purchase up to 1 million shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock at a price of $138.90 per share in cash. TRC Capital Investment’s offer price of $138.90 per share is approximately 4.48 percent lower than the $145.41 closing share price of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock on February 6, 2024 – the business day prior to the date of the offer. This offer to purchase up to 1 million shares by TRC Capital Investment represents less than 0.02 percent of the shares of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock outstanding as of the February 7, 2024 offer date.\nAlphabet does not endorse TRC Capital Investment’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares in response to TRC Capital Investment’s offer because the offer is at a price below the current market price for Alphabet’s Class C shares and subject to numerous conditions. Alphabet is not affiliated or associated in any way with TRC Capital Investment, its mini-tender offer or its offer documentation.\nTRC Capital Investment’s has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws.\nThe SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders making mini-tender offers at below-market prices are “hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” More on the SEC’s guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.\nAlphabet urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor and to exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital Investment’s offer. Alphabet recommends that stockholders who have not responded to TRC Capital Investment’s offer take no action. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with TRC Capital Investment’s offer documentation. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2024. TRC Capital Investment may extend the offering period at its discretion.\nAlphabet encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.\nAlphabet requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions relating to TRC Capital Investment’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Alphabet stock.\nAbout Alphabet Inc.\nAlphabet is a collection of companies, the largest of which is Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in September 1998 and the company is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif. Billions of people use its wide range of popular products and platforms each day, like Search, Ads, Chrome, Cloud, YouTube and Android.\nContact\nInvestor Relations:\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\nMedia:\npress@abc.xyz", "sublinks": [{"url": "https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm", "extracted_text": "Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors\nMost investors welcome tender offers because they frequently provide a rare opportunity to sell securities at a premium above market price. But investors should know that not all tender offers are alike.\n\"Mini-tender\" offers – tender offers for less than five percent of a company's stock – have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard. Many investors who hear about mini-tender offers surrender their securities without investigating the offer, assuming that the price offered includes the premium usually present in larger, traditional tender offers. But they later learn that they cannot withdraw from the offer and may end up selling their securities at below-market prices.\nIf you've been asked to tender your securities, find out first whether the offer is a mini-tender offer. And remember that mini-tender offers typically do not provide the same disclosure and procedural protections that larger, traditional tender offers provide. For example, when a bidder – the person or group of people behind the offer – makes a tender offer for more than five percent of the company's shares, all of the SEC's tender offer rules apply. These rules require bidders to:\n- Disclose important information about themselves;\n- Disclose the terms of the offer;\n- File their offering documents with the SEC; and\n- Provide the target company and any competing bidders with information about the tender offer.\nThe rules also give investors important protections, including the right to:\n- Change their minds and withdraw from the transaction while the offer remains open;\n- Have their shares accepted on a \"pro rata\" basis (if the offer is for less than all of the company's outstanding shares and investors tender too many shares); and\n- Be treated equally by the bidder.\nBut none of the rules listed above applies to mini-tender offers.\nInstead, the only rules that encompass mini-tender offers – Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act and Regulation 14E – provide that bidders must:\n- Not engage in fraud or deceptive practices;\n- Hold open tender offers for minimum time periods; and\n- Make prompt payment to investors after the offer closes.\nRegulation 14E also requires the target company to state its position about the offer by recommending that investors accept or reject the offer. The company may also state that it remains neutral or takes no position. But because bidders in mini-tender offers don't have to notify the target, the target may not even know about the offer.\nInvestors need to scrutinize mini-tender offers carefully. Some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price. Others make mini-tender offers at a premium – betting that the market price will rise before the offer closes and then extending the offer until it does or improperly canceling if it doesn't.\nWith most mini-tender offers, investors typically feel pressured to tender their shares quickly without having solid information about the offer or the people behind it. And they've been shocked to learn that they generally cannot withdraw from mini-tender offers.\nHere are the steps you should take if you are asked to sell your stock, bonds, limited partnership interests, or other securities through a mini-tender offer:\n- Find out whether the offer is a mini-tender offer.\n- Most bidders won't use the term \"mini-tender offer\" to describe their offer to buy your shares. Instead, they may call it a \"Solicitation to Purchase Shares of XYZ Corporation.\" Ask the bidder – or your broker – what percentage of the company the bidder seeks to purchase. If the answer is less than five percent, you're dealing with a mini-tender offer, and you should proceed with caution.\n- Get a copy of the offering document.\n- And be sure to read the disclosure carefully. Do not make an investment decision until you see the disclosure about the offer.\n- Determine whether the bidder has adequate financing.\n- Some bidders make mini-tender offers because they can do so at virtually no cost. These individuals often do not have the financing necessary to purchase the shares in the offer. Before you surrender your securities in a mini-tender offer, ask tough questions – and demand answers – about the bidder's ability to pay once the offer closes.\n- Identify the current market price for your securities.\n- For stock, you can easily get price information in many newspapers, on-line, or from your broker or investment adviser. For bonds and limited partnerships, you may need to talk with your broker or investment adviser because these prices may be hard to find. For limited partnerships, contact the general partner to get a list of firms that buy and sell the limited partnership, or ask your broker or investment adviser.\n- Find out the \"final\" tender offer price after all deductions are taken.\n- In some tender offers, you may get a lower price because deductions are taken from the tender offer price for dividend payments. Also, some bidders in mini-tender offers fail to disclose clearly that certain fees or expenses may also be deducted from the offer price.\n- Ask when you'll be paid for the shares you tender.\n- Bidders in mini-tender offers sometimes fail to provide prompt payment, sometimes delaying for weeks or months. Before you tender your shares, be sure to find out when the bidder will pay you for your shares.\n- Consult with your broker or other financial adviser.\n- Make sure you understand the terms of the tender offer before tendering your shares. Ask for any additional written information that may be available.\n- If you want to sell your shares, determine where you can get your best price.\n- Check all your alternatives for selling your securities. For instance, compare how much you will receive if you sell through your broker versus the tender offer.\n- Remember that once you agree to a mini-tender offer, you are probably locked in.\n- If the tender offer is for less than five percent of the company's stock, exercise extreme caution. Unlike other tender offers, you generally cannot change your mind after you have tendered your shares in a mini-tender offer, even if the offer hasn't yet closed. In addition, the bidder can extend the tender offer without giving you the right to withdraw your shares. And in the meantime, you've lost control over the securities you tendered.\nIf you've run into trouble with a mini-tender offer, act promptly. By law, you only have a limited time to take legal action.\nContact the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy for help. You can send us your complaint using our online complaint form.

In the past two and a half years, as mini-tender offers have become prevalent, issues have arisen concerning mini-tender offer information dissemination by broker-dealers. As you are aware, mini-tender offer bidders have often structured these offers to take advantage of security holders. For example, mini-tender offer bidders have (1) inadequately disseminated offering documents to security holders; (2) extended below market value offers; (3) made offers slightly above current market value but extended the offers past the initial expiration date until the market price rose above the tender price; (4) lowered the offering price by fees or distributions received after a particular date; (5) extended offers on a first come, first purchase basis without providing withdrawal rights; (6) extended offers without the financial ability to consummate the offers and structured offers so the bidder gained control of tendered securities without making payment; and (7) offered to exchange liquid securities for illiquid securities. These offers continue to victimize investors.\nBroker-dealers that hold customers' securities that are the subject of mini-tender offers have to decide whether to forward mini-tender offer information to such customers and what, if any, disclaimers should accompany this information. In this letter, we discuss our understanding of current broker-dealer practices and potentially problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices, and offer guidance for broker-dealers regarding their dissemination of mini-tender offer information.\nCurrent Broker-Dealer Practices\nWe are aware that broker-dealers employ a variety of practices to disseminate mini-tender offer information. Some broker-dealers review mini-tender offers prior to making a decision about whether to forward notice of the offers to customers. Some firms provide disclaimer language when they forward mini-tender offer information to customers. Other broker-dealers do not forward any mini-tender offers to customers. We do not suggest that broker-dealers should follow a uniform standard in this regard. Rather, our goal in this letter is to provide guidance for broker-dealers to consider when deciding whether and how to disseminate mini-tender offer information.\nProblematic Mini-Tender Offer Practices\nBroker-dealers should be alert to the following mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially victimize investors. A detailed discussion of many of these practices is contained in the interpretive release entitled, Commission Guidance on Mini-Tender Offers and Limited Partnership Tender Offers (the Release).1\nA. Inadequate Dissemination\nA bidder may violate Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) if the bidder does not make reasonable efforts to disseminate material information about the mini-tender offer to security holders. The Commission has stated that there are three methods of adequate dissemination: (1) publishing the mini-tender offering document in a newspaper; (2) publishing a summary of the offering in the newspaper and mailing the complete offering document to security holders; or (3) mailing the offering document to security holders using a security holder list.2 The Release states that it is not adequate bidder dissemination to forward the offering information to the Depository Trust Company or a brokerage firm or to post it on a web site.\nB. Inadequate Disclosure of Offer Price\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder is offering a premium for the targeted security when in fact the offer price may be below current market value. We recognize that there may be circumstances when acceptance of a mini-tender offer may be in a customer's interest because there is an illiquid market for that security. Limited partnership mini-tender offers may sometimes fall into this category. However, there have been numerous mini-tender offers for highly liquid securities that offer a price below current market value.\nBidders might set a mini-tender offer price at, or slightly above, the current market value. However, the bidder may extend the offer beyond the initial expiration date until such time as the market price rises above the mini-tender offer price. If this occurs, a security holder may lose control of his shares while the offer is extended because mini-tender offers generally do not provide withdrawal rights.\nBroker-dealers should be alert to mini-tender offers for securities in which trading is halted. The failure to include a current market price in the offering documents is a possible indication that trading is halted. NASD Rule 3340 prohibits effecting transactions in halted securities.3\nC. Price Changes\nOften, a bidder will specify a mini-tender offer price but provide that transfer fees, distributions, or interest received after a certain date may reduce the mini-tender offer price. Therefore, even if the stated offer price is above the current market value, some customers may not fully appreciate that the actual offer price that will be received, once distributions or other amounts are deducted, may be below the current market value. Also, the market price of a security may rise or decline after the bidder disseminates the offer.\nD. First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\nThe first come, first purchase terms may pressure customers to make hasty, uninformed tender decisions. The failure to provide withdrawal rights leaves shareholders without a means to reconsider their decisions to tender. Moreover, the lack of withdrawal rights means that shareholders lose control of their securities for the duration of the mini-tender offer, including potentially lengthy periods if the mini-tender offer is extended.\nE. Inability to Finance the Offer\nCustomers may assume that a mini-tender offer bidder has the ability to pay for an offer and that the bidder will gain control of tendered shares only if the bidder pays for the shares. However, a bidder may extend a mini-tender offer when he does not have the ability to pay for the shares. The bidder may also structure the offer without using an escrow account or independent receiving agent in order to gain control of the shares before making payment.4 If a mini-tender offer bidder structures an offer so that tendered shares are routed to the bidder's account prior to the bidder making payment, customers may risk tendering their shares without receiving payment.\nF. Exchange Offers for Privately Held Companies\nA mini-tender offer bidder may offer to purchase publicly traded, liquid securities in exchange for the securities of privately held corporations for which there is no public market. Investors may not be adequately informed that by participating in such an exchange offer, they will receive an illiquid security.\nBroker-Dealer Dissemination of Mini-Tender Offer Information\nThere is no Exchange Act rule that specifically addresses the practice of broker-dealers forwarding mini-tender offer information to their customers. Thus, there is no requirement under the Exchange Act mandating that a broker-dealer forward mini-tender offer information to its customers.5\nWe support the position set forth in NYSE Information Memo 99-11 that it is a prudent practice for broker-dealers to review a mini-tender offer when making a decision about whether to forward mini-tender offer information. In that process, we suggest broker-dealers consider the problematic bidder practices mentioned above.\nBest Practice Guidance\nA broker-dealer's principal means for forwarding to customers information about tender offers is the mailing of a notice on the brokerage firm's letterhead. We believe that it is consistent with achieving a high level of investor protection for the broker-dealer to inform its customers of potentially problematic bidder practices. Broker-dealers may perform a disservice to customers if they forward mini-tender offer information to customers without providing information in their notices regarding problematic bidder practices.\nWithout adequate information, a customer may assume that a mini-tender offer has the same procedural protections that a traditional tender offer provides and that the mini-tender offer price is at a premium above market price. Moreover, customers might assume that a broker-dealer is endorsing a mini-tender offer because the notice is on the firm's letterhead. This concern is heightened if the broker-dealer's notice encourages participation in a mini-tender offer. For example, a statement in a broker-dealer's notice may encourage participation in a mini-tender offer if it instructs customers to act quickly or risk losing a valuable investment opportunity, or if it states that failure to respond to the offer may result in adverse financial consequences.\nSome broker-dealers provide information in their notices concerning mini-tender bidder practices. Some notices provide better information than others regarding potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. Other broker-dealers' notices may not provide any information about bidder practices. Accordingly, we suggest as a best practice that broker-dealers provide customers with information about problematic mini-tender offer bidder practices whenever they forward mini-tender offer information to their customers.6 Specifically, we suggest using the information delineated below to alert customers of potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices.\nMini-Tender Offer Information7\n- Definition\n- Mini-tender offers are offers for less than five percent of a company's equity securities that are not subject to the disclosure and procedural rules that apply to other types of tender offers.\n- Offer Price\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may be offering you a price for your securities that is less than the current market value of your securities. You should check the current market price of your security to help you decide whether this is an offer that you should accept.\n- A mini-tender offer with an above-market value tender price may be extended beyond the initial expiration date. In such a case, the market price may rise above the tender price while the offer is extended. If this occurs, you may tender at a price below what you would have received if you sold your shares in the market. Compare the price you would receive if you tender and the price that you would receive if you sell your shares through your broker-dealer.\n- Price Changes\n- In some mini-tender offers, you may get a lower price than indicated in the offer because deductions are taken from the price for dividend payments, distributions, or other fees. You should determine the \"final\" tender payment after all deductions are taken before you tender.\n- First Come, First Purchase/No Withdrawal Rights\n- A mini-tender offer may be structured on a first come, first purchase basis, which means that the person making the offer accepts shares in order of receipt. This may place pressure on you to quickly tender your shares in order to be accepted into the mini-tender offer without having solid information about the offer and the person making the offer. Be sure that you understand the terms of a mini-tender offer before tendering your shares. You should obtain a copy of the offering document and read it carefully.\n- A mini-tender offer may not provide withdrawal rights, which means that you are locked into the mini-tender offer once you offer to tender your shares. You cannot change your mind after you tender your shares, even if the offer has not closed. In addition, the bidder can extend the mini-tender offer without giving you the right to withdraw your shares. In the meantime, you lose control over your securities and you may not have received payment.\n- Ability to Finance the Offer\n- The person making the mini-tender offer may receive your tendered shares before he pays you for your shares. Additionally, the person making the mini-tender offer might not have the funds to pay you at all. You could lose your shares without ever being paid. Alternatively, even if you are paid for tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer, the person making the offer could delay making the payment for weeks or months.\n- Exchange Offers\n- You may be asked to tender a security that is publicly traded on an exchange or over-the-counter and in return you will receive a security that is not publicly traded. As such, you may receive shares through a mini-tender offer that you cannot easily sell.\n- Additional Information\n- The target company is required to state its position about the offer by recommending that investors accept or reject the offer.\n- Persons considering the offer should consult with a financial advisor.\n- Compare all your alternatives for selling your securities before tendering your shares in a mini-tender offer.\n- You may obtain additional information about mini-tender offers by visiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.\nThis information could be conveyed in various formats. It could be added to a broker-dealer's current notice. We are aware, however, that broker-dealers may have systems limitations in the way that they include information in their notices. Therefore, we suggest two alternative means of conveying the information if it is used in the notice. First, the information could be used with only the mini-tender offer notices that a broker-dealer sends to customers. However, some firms' systems may not distinguish between mini-tender offers and other tender offers. Instead, their systems generate the same notice for all tender offers, including mini-tender offers. If this is the case, the notice could dedicate a section to mini-tender offers. In order to avoid customer confusion, firms could clearly indicate in the notice that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers and customers can refer to the notice's definition of a mini-tender offer and contact their financial advisor to determine whether the offer is a mini-tender offer.\nAs an alternative, a broker-dealer could mail the Commission's publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors (a copy of which is attached), with its notice rather than incorporating the information delineated above into the notice. This insert could be mailed only with mini-tender offer notices or with all tender offer and mini-tender offer notices that the broker-dealer forwards to customers. If the mailing is done with all tender offers, it would be helpful for firms to indicate that not all tender offers are mini-tender offers. In order to determine if an offer is a mini-tender offer, customers can refer to the publication and contact their financial advisor.\nIf an on-line broker-dealer sends its tender offer notices to customers via e-mail rather than sending the notice through the mail, that firm could incorporate the above information into its e-mail notice. In addition, on-line broker-dealers could also provide the information again at the time a customer enters tender instructions on-line. It could do so by hyperlinking to the Commission's on-line publication regarding mini-tender offers.\nOf course, brokerage firms may formulate their own version of this information. However, we believe that this information describes the types of mini-tender offer bidder practices that potentially disadvantage customers. Brokerage firms might add supplementary information as warranted by mini-tender bidder practices.\nAdditionally, broker-dealers might also publish information on their websites regarding mini-tender offers and potentially abusive mini-tender offer bidder practices. The website page could incorporate statements from the above-suggested information and be modeled after the mini-tender notice published on the Commission's website. A broker-dealer's website publication should not be employed as an alternative to incorporating the above information into its notice or mailing an insert to customers because it is likely that not all of the target shareholder customers have access to the Internet or will be aware that this important information is on the broker-dealer's website. Brokerage firms could also hyperlink their websites to the Commission's on-line publication, Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors.\nWe believe that broker-dealers and investors should be alert to the problematic features of some mini-tender offers. We encourage broker-dealers to consider the recommendations in this letter when forwarding mini-tender offer information to customers. We believe that it will assist investors in making better-informed decisions about mini-tender offers.\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact James Brigagliano, Assistant Director, or Elizabeth Sandoe, Attorney, in the Office of Trading Practices, Division of Market Regulation at (202) 942-0772.\nSincerely,\nAnnette L.

Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 30, 2024. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful\n3\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\nInterest income\n$\n659\n$\n1,110\nInterest expense\n(90)\n(69)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(185)\n(449)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(176)\n(115)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(1,487)\n586\nPerformance fees\n193\n(45)\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(31)\n(256)\nOther\n104\n(47)\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(1,013)\n$\n715\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q4 2023, the net effect of the gain on equity securities of $586 million and the $45 million of performance fees related to certain investments increased the provision for\n8\nincome tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $114 million, $427 million, and $0.03, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n18,915\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(11,019)\nFree cash flow\n$\n7,896\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n9\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022 to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2023\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2023\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter

The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services.\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2022\n2023\n(recast)\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n18,883\n$\n23,937\nGoogle Cloud\n(440)\n266\nOther Bets\n(1,225)\n(1,194)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1)\n(83)\n(1,666)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n17,135\n$\n21,343\n(1)\nIn addition to the Alphabet-level costs included in unallocated corporate costs, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue were $638 million and $(1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n2\nAdditional Information Relating to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023\n(unaudited)\nReductions in Our Workforce and Office Space\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million and $649 million, respectively. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in our segment results.\nChange in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023, and the effect was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nA live audio webcast of our third quarter 2023 earnings release call will be available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXQInS9SV2Q. The call begins today at 1:30 PM (PT) / 4:30 PM (ET). This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.\nWe also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).\nWe also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 24, 2023. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign\n3\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n4\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of September 30,\n2022\n2023\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n21,879\n$\n30,702\nMarketable securities\n91,883\n89,233\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n113,762\n119,935\nAccounts receivable, net\n40,258\n41,020\nInventory\n2,670\n2,957\nOther current assets\n8,105\n12,398\nTotal current assets\n164,795\n176,310\nNon-marketable securities\n30,492\n30,907\nDeferred income taxes\n5,261\n10,983\nProperty and equipment, net\n112,668\n125,705\nOperating lease assets\n14,381\n14,199\nIntangible assets, net\n2,084\n1,833\nGoodwill\n28,960\n29,146\nOther non-current assets\n6,623\n7,628\nTotal assets\n$\n365,264\n$\n396,711\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n5,128\n$\n5,803\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n14,028\n12,562\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n37,866\n55,602\nAccrued revenue share\n8,370\n8,025\nDeferred revenue\n3,908\n4,303\nTotal current liabilities\n69,300\n86,295\nLong-term debt\n14,701\n13,781\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n599\n884\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,258\n8,038\nDeferred income taxes\n514\n528\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,501\n12,550\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,247\n1,433\nTotal liabilities\n109,120\n123,509\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n8\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2022\n2023\nInterest income\n$\n615\n$\n1,066\nInterest expense\n(101)\n(116)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(136)\n(311)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(731)\n(503)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(647)\n(366)\nPerformance fees\n54\n179\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(99)\n(215)\nOther\n143\n120\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(902)\n$\n(146)\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q3 2023, the net effect of the loss on equity securities of $366 million and the $179 million of performance fees related to certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $39 million, $148 million, and $0.01, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nReconciliation from Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n30,656\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(8,055)\nFree cash flow\n$\n22,601\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\n9\nReconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended September 30, 2022 to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2023\n% Change from Prior

The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 25, 2023. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n8\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended June 30,\n2022\n2023\nInterest income\n$\n486\n$\n892\nInterest expense\n(83)\n(43)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(260)\n(268)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(790)\n(304)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n(251)\n(205)\nPerformance fees\n318\n5\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n(118)\n(106)\nOther\n259\n94\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(439)\n$\n65\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities.

We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2022 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2023\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter Ended June

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering our cost base.”\nQ1 2023 financial highlights\n(unaudited)\nOur first quarter 2023 results reflect:\ni.\n$2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space;\nii.\na $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment; and\niii.\na shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less stock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023.\nFor further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2023 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2022\n2023\nRevenues\n$\n68,011\n$\n69,787\nChange in revenues year over year\n23\n%\n3\n%\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year\n(1)\n26\n%\n6\n%\nOperating income\n$\n20,094\n$\n17,415\nOperating margin\n30\n%\n25\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(1,160)\n$\n790\nNet income\n$\n16,436\n$\n15,051\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.23\n$\n1.17\n(1)\nNon-GAAP measure.

We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nSegment Operating Results\nReflecting DeepMind’s increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making\n.\nPrior periods have been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below\n.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called Google DeepMind, will be reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of 2023.\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2022\n2023\n(recast)\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n21,973\n$\n21,737\nGoogle Cloud\n(706)\n191\nOther Bets\n(835)\n(1,225)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1)\n(338)\n(3,288)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n20,094\n$\n17,415\n(1)\nHedging gains (losses) related to revenue included in unallocated corporate costs were $278 million and $84 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion.\n2\nAdditional information relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nReductions in Our Workforce and Office Space\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nThese severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):\nSeverance and Related\nOffice Space\nTotal\nCost of revenues\n$\n461\n$\n220\n$\n681\nResearch and development\n835\n247\n1,082\nSales and marketing\n445\n35\n480\nGeneral and administrative\n253\n62\n315\nTotal charges\n$\n1,994\n$\n564\n$\n2,558\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in our segment results.\nChange in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share.\nTiming of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants\nBeginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year.\nStock Repurchases\nOn April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.\nWebcast and conference call information\nA live audio webcast of our first quarter 2023 earnings release call will be available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76CVRgZUfps. The call begins today at 2:00 PM (PT) / 5:00 PM (ET). This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.\nWe also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).\nWe also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future\n3\nperformance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 25, 2023. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n4\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of March 31,\n2022\n2023\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n21,879\n$\n25,924\nMarketable securities\n91,883\n89,178\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n113,762\n115,102\nAccounts receivable, net\n40,258\n36,036\nInventory\n2,670\n2,315\nOther current assets\n8,105\n8,532\nTotal current assets\n164,795\n161,985\nNon-marketable securities\n30,492\n31,213\nDeferred income taxes\n5,261\n6,885\nProperty and equipment, net\n112,668\n117,560\nOperating lease assets\n14,381\n14,447\nIntangible assets, net\n2,084\n1,968\nGoodwill\n28,960\n28,994\nOther non-current assets\n6,623\n6,439\nTotal assets\n$\n365,264\n$\n369,491\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n5,128\n$\n4,184\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n14,028\n9,954\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n37,866\n43,185\nAccrued revenue share\n8,370\n7,816\nDeferred revenue\n3,908\n3,715\nTotal current liabilities\n69,300\n68,854\nLong-term debt\n14,701\n13,697\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n599\n610\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,258\n9,722\nDeferred income taxes\n514\n542\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,501\n12,799\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,247\n2,373\nTotal liabilities\n109,120\n108,597\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 to the Quarter Ended March 31, 2023\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2023\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter Ended

We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nWe also announced actions to optimize our global office space and our expectation that we would incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of the severance and office space exit charges will be included within Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs.\nYou will see a tabular disclosure of these charges in our upcoming first quarter 2023 Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings press release in the following format:\nSeverance and Related\nOffice Space\nTotal\nCost of revenues\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal charges\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nii.\nChanges in useful lives of server and network equipment\nIn January 2023 we\ncompleted an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. For assets in service as of December 31, 2022, we expect that the effect of this change will be a reduction of depreciation expense of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023. We will disclose the effect of the change on our depreciation expense, net income, and earnings per share in our quarterly and annual fiscal year 2023 reporting.\niii.\nChange in the segment reporting of DeepMind\nIn our fourth quarter earnings release, we announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2023, DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs reflecting its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.\nToday we further announced that we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change will not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called Google DeepMind, will be reported in Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of 2023.\nTwo additional changes effective beginning in the first quarter of 2023:\niv.\nChanges in segment cost allocations\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. For example: (i) certain costs associated with corporate initiatives supporting consumer-facing activities, previously reflected in unallocated corporate costs, are now allocated to Google Services; and (ii) centrally-managed shared research and development activities, including our shared developer tools, are now allocated based on an updated measure of the relative benefit derived from the services.\nAs a result of these changes, more of the previously unallocated corporate costs are allocated to our segments, and more of certain previously allocated costs are allocated to our consumer-facing Google Services products and less to Google Cloud enterprise products.\nv.\nTiming of our annual employee equity grants\nIn the second quarter of 2022 we informed our employees that, beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards would shift from January to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full f\niscal year 2023\n, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year.\nRecast historical segment results\nAfter the segment reporting changes noted in items (iii) and (iv) above, unallocated corporate costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; and corporate shared costs such as finance, certain human resource costs, and legal, including certain fines and settlements. In the first quarter of 2023, unallocated corporate costs will also include charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue continue to be included in unallocated corporate costs.\nIn our Q1 reported results, you will see that prior periods have been recast to reflect the revised segment presentation of DeepMind and the cost allocation changes, respectively items (iii) and (iv) above.\nRecast\nhistorical segment results are as follows (in millions):\nQuarter\nFiscal Year\nRecast Historical Results\nQ1 2022\nQ2 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ4 2022\n2021\n2022\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n21,973\n$\n21,621\n$\n18,883\n$\n20,222\n$\n88,132\n$\n82,699\nGoogle Cloud\n(706)\n(590)\n(440)\n(186)\n(2,282)\n(1,922)\nOther Bets\n(835)\n(1,339)\n(1,225)\n(1,237)\n(4,051)\n(4,636)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1)\n(338)\n(239)\n(83)\n(639)\n(3,085)\n(1,299)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n20,094\n$\n19,453\n$\n17,135\n$\n18,160\n$\n78,714\n$\n74,842\n(1)\nIncludes hedging gains (losses); in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 hedging gains of $149 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.\nFor reference\n, segment results as previously reported are as follows (in millions):\nQuarter\nFiscal Year\nPreviously Reported Historical Results\nQ1 2022\nQ2 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ4 2022\n2021\n2022\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n22,920\n$\n22,770\n$\n19,781\n$\n21,101\n$\n91,855\n$\n86,572\nGoogle Cloud\n(931)\n(858)\n(699)\n(480)\n(3,099)\n(2,968)\nOther Bets\n(1,155)\n(1,686)\n(1,611)\n(1,631)\n(5,281)\n(6,083)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1)\n(740)\n(773)\n(336)\n(830)\n(4,761)\n(2,679)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n20,094\n$\n19,453\n$\n17,135\n$\n18,160\n$\n78,714\n$\n74,842\n(1)\nIncludes hedging gains (losses); in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 hedging gains of $149 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.\nPosted by Amie Thuener, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer\nForward-looking statements\nThis blog post may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

We’re on an important journey to re-engineer our cost structure in a durable way and to build financially sustainable, vibrant, growing businesses across Alphabet.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Our Q4 consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% year over year, or up 7% in constant currency, and $283 billion for the full year 2022, up 10%, or up 14% in constant currency. We have significant work underway to improve all aspects of our cost structure, in support of our investments in our highest growth priorities to deliver long-term, profitable growth.”\nQ4 2022 financial highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\nQuarter Ended December 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nRevenues\n$\n75,325\n$\n76,048\n$\n257,637\n$\n282,836\nChange in revenues year over year\n32\n%\n1\n%\n41\n%\n10\n%\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year\n(1)\n33\n%\n7\n%\n39\n%\n14\n%\nOperating income\n$\n21,885\n$\n18,160\n$\n78,714\n$\n74,842\nOperating margin\n29\n%\n24\n%\n31\n%\n26\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n2,517\n$\n(1,013)\n$\n12,020\n$\n(3,514)\nNet income\n$\n20,642\n$\n13,624\n$\n76,033\n$\n59,972\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.53\n$\n1.05\n$\n5.61\n$\n4.56\n(1)\nNon-GAAP measure.

DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\n2021\n2022\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n20,945\n$\n21,879\nMarketable securities\n118,704\n91,883\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n139,649\n113,762\nAccounts receivable, net\n39,304\n40,258\nInventory\n1,170\n2,670\nOther current assets\n8,020\n8,105\nTotal current assets\n188,143\n164,795\nNon-marketable securities\n29,549\n30,492\nDeferred income taxes\n1,284\n5,261\nProperty and equipment, net\n97,599\n112,668\nOperating lease assets\n12,959\n14,381\nIntangible assets, net\n1,417\n2,084\nGoodwill\n22,956\n28,960\nOther non-current assets\n5,361\n6,623\nTotal assets\n$\n359,268\n$\n365,264\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n6,037\n$\n5,128\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n13,889\n14,028\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n32,044\n37,866\nAccrued revenue share\n8,996\n8,370\nDeferred revenue\n3,288\n3,908\nTotal current liabilities\n64,254\n69,300\nLong-term debt\n14,817\n14,701\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n535\n599\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,176\n9,258\nDeferred income taxes\n5,257\n514\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,389\n12,501\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,205\n2,247\nTotal liabilities\n107,633\n109,120\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOther income (expense), net\nThe following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended December 31,\n2021\n2022\nInterest income\n$\n378\n$\n659\nInterest expense\n(117)\n(90)\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n(163)\n(185)\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n(172)\n(176)\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n(1)\n2,650\n(1,487)\nPerformance fees\n(228)\n193\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n49\n(31)\nOther\n120\n104\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n2,517\n$\n(1,013)\n(1)\nIncludes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q4 2022, the net effect of the loss on equity securities of $1.5 billion and the $193 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $272 million, $1.0 billion, and $0.08, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significan\ntly contr\nibute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\n7\nReconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\n(in millions; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n23,614\nLess: purchases of property and equipment\n(7,595)\nFree cash flow\n$\n16,019\nFree cash flow:\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nReconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues\n(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)\n:\nWe provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.\nNon-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\nRevenues by Geography\nComparison from the Quarter Ended December 31, 2021 to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2022\n% Change from Prior Period\nQuarter

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We’re sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. Product announcements we’ve made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to both Search and Cloud, powered by AI, and new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts. We are focused on both investing responsibly for the long term and being responsive to the economic environment.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Our third quarter revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6% versus last year or up 11% on a constant currency basis. Financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We’re working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.”\nQ3 2022 financial highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages; unaudited).\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2021\n2022\nRevenues\n$\n65,118\n$\n69,092\nChange in revenues year over year\n41\n%\n6\n%\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year\n(1)\n39\n%\n11\n%\nOperating income\n$\n21,031\n$\n17,135\nOperating margin\n32\n%\n25\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n2,033\n$\n(902)\nNet income\n$\n18,936\n$\n13,910\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.40\n$\n1.06\n(1)\nNon-GAAP measure.

This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.\nWe also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).\nWe also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 25, 2022. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in\n2\nthis press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of September 30,\n2021\n2022\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n20,945\n$\n21,984\nMarketable securities\n118,704\n94,275\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n139,649\n116,259\nAccounts receivable, net\n39,304\n34,697\nIncome taxes receivable, net\n966\n1,479\nInventory\n1,170\n3,156\nOther current assets\n7,054\n10,518\nTotal current assets\n188,143\n166,109\nNon-marketable securities\n29,549\n30,419\nDeferred income taxes\n1,284\n2,991\nProperty and equipment, net\n97,599\n108,363\nOperating lease assets\n12,959\n13,677\nIntangible assets, net\n1,417\n2,192\nGoodwill\n22,956\n28,834\nOther non-current assets\n5,361\n5,670\nTotal assets\n$\n359,268\n$\n358,255\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n6,037\n$\n6,303\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n13,889\n12,366\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n31,236\n35,038\nAccrued revenue share\n8,996\n7,662\nDeferred revenue\n3,288\n3,585\nIncome taxes payable, net\n808\n1,025\nTotal current liabilities\n64,254\n65,979\nLong-term debt\n14,817\n14,653\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n535\n594\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,176\n8,572\nDeferred income taxes\n5,257\n476\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,389\n11,984\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,205\n2,371\nTotal liabilities\n107,633\n104,629\nContingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contr\nibute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.\nSegment results\nThe following table presents our revenues and operating income (loss) (in millions; unaudited):\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2021\n2022\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services\n$\n59,884\n$\n61,377\nGoogle Cloud\n4,990\n6,868\nOther Bets\n182\n209\nHedging gains (losses)\n62\n638\nTotal revenues\n$\n65,118\n$\n69,092\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n23,973\n$\n19,781\nGoogle Cloud\n(644)\n(699)\nOther Bets\n(1,288)\n(1,611)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1,010)\n(336)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n21,031\n$\n17,135\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n•\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube.

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “In the second quarter our performance was driven by Search and Cloud. The investments we’ve made over the years in AI and computing are helping to make our services particularly valuable for consumers, and highly effective for businesses of all sizes. As we sharpen our focus, we’ll continue to invest responsibly in deep computer science for the long-term.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Our consistent investments to support long-term growth are reflected in our solid performance in the second quarter, with revenues of $69.7 billion in the quarter, up 13% versus last year or 16% on a constant currency basis. We are focused on responsible capital allocation in support of our growth opportunities.”\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All references made to share or per share amounts in this press release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\nQ2 2022 financial highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages; unaudited).\nQuarter Ended June 30,\n2021\n2022\nRevenues\n$\n61,880\n$\n69,685\nChange in revenues year over year\n(1)\n62\n%\n13\n%\nChange in constant currency revenues year over year\n(1) (2)\n57\n%\n16\n%\nOperating income\n$\n19,361\n$\n19,453\nOperating margin\n31\n%\n28\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n2,624\n$\n(439)\nNet income\n$\n18,525\n$\n16,002\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.36\n$\n1.21\n(1)\nForeign currency movements affected year-over-year revenue growth rates by 3.7%.

This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.\nWe also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).\nWe also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is\n2\nas of July 26, 2022. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of June 30,\n2021\n2022\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n20,945\n$\n17,936\nMarketable securities\n118,704\n107,061\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n139,649\n124,997\nAccounts receivable, net\n39,304\n35,707\nIncome taxes receivable, net\n966\n1,366\nInventory\n1,170\n1,980\nOther current assets\n7,054\n8,321\nTotal current assets\n188,143\n172,371\nNon-marketable securities\n29,549\n30,665\nDeferred income taxes\n1,284\n1,490\nProperty and equipment, net\n97,599\n106,223\nOperating lease assets\n12,959\n13,398\nIntangible assets, net\n1,417\n1,377\nGoodwill\n22,956\n23,949\nOther non-current assets\n5,361\n5,712\nTotal assets\n$\n359,268\n$\n355,185\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n6,037\n$\n4,409\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n13,889\n10,852\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n31,236\n32,976\nAccrued revenue share\n8,996\n7,889\nDeferred revenue\n3,288\n3,272\nIncome taxes payable, net\n808\n1,956\nTotal current liabilities\n64,254\n61,354\nLong-term debt\n14,817\n14,734\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n535\n472\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,176\n8,163\nDeferred income taxes\n5,257\n924\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,389\n11,697\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,205\n2,422\nTotal liabilities\n107,633\n99,766\nContingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100 shares authorized;

This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.\nWe also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).\nWe also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 26, 2022. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe\n2\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of March 31,\n2021\n2022\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n20,945\n$\n20,886\nMarketable securities\n118,704\n113,084\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n139,649\n133,970\nAccounts receivable, net\n39,304\n34,703\nIncome taxes receivable, net\n966\n919\nInventory\n1,170\n1,369\nOther current assets\n7,054\n6,892\nTotal current assets\n188,143\n177,853\nNon-marketable securities\n29,549\n30,544\nDeferred income taxes\n1,284\n1,388\nProperty and equipment, net\n97,599\n104,218\nOperating lease assets\n12,959\n12,992\nIntangible assets, net\n1,417\n1,313\nGoodwill\n22,956\n23,010\nOther non-current assets\n5,361\n5,778\nTotal assets\n$\n359,268\n$\n357,096\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n6,037\n$\n3,436\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n13,889\n9,803\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n31,236\n33,051\nAccrued revenue share\n8,996\n8,116\nDeferred revenue\n3,288\n3,198\nIncome taxes payable, net\n808\n4,344\nTotal current liabilities\n64,254\n61,948\nLong-term debt\n14,817\n14,791\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n535\n499\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n9,176\n9,406\nDeferred income taxes\n5,257\n2,843\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,389\n11,363\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,205\n2,242\nTotal liabilities\n107,633\n103,092\nContingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100,000 shares authorized;

Q4 saw ongoing strong growth in our advertising business, which helped millions of businesses thrive and find new customers, a quarterly sales record for our Pixel phones despite supply constraints, and our Cloud business continuing to grow strongly.”\nRuth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Our fourth quarter revenues of $75 billion, up 32% year over year, reflected broad-based strength in advertiser spend and strong consumer online activity, as well as substantial ongoing revenue growth from Google Cloud. Our investments have helped us drive this growth by delivering the services that people, our partners and businesses need, and we continue to invest in long-term opportunities.”\nQ4 2021 financial highlights\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages).\nQuarter Ended December 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n2021\n2020\n2021\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nRevenues\n$\n56,898\n$\n75,325\n$\n182,527\n$\n257,637\nIncrease in revenues year over year\n23\n%\n32\n%\n13\n%\n41\n%\nOperating income\n$\n15,651\n$\n21,885\n$\n41,224\n$\n78,714\nOperating margin\n28\n%\n29\n%\n23\n%\n31\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n3,038\n$\n2,517\n$\n6,858\n$\n12,020\nNet income\n$\n15,227\n$\n20,642\n$\n40,269\n$\n76,033\nDiluted EPS\n$\n22.30\n$\n30.69\n$\n58.61\n$\n112.20\nQ4 2021 supplemental information\n(in millions, except for number of employees; unaudited)\nRevenues, Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) and number of employees\nQuarter Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\nGoogle Search & other\n$\n31,903\n$\n43,301\nYouTube ads\n6,885\n8,633\nGoogle Network\n7,411\n9,305\nGoogle advertising\n46,199\n61,239\nGoogle other\n6,674\n8,161\nGoogle Services total\n52,873\n69,400\nGoogle Cloud\n3,831\n5,541\nOther Bets\n196\n181\nHedging gains (losses)\n(2)\n203\nTotal revenues\n$\n56,898\n$\n75,325\nTotal TAC\n$\n10,466\n$\n13,427\nNumber of employees\n135,301\n156,500\nSegment Operating Results\nQuarter Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n19,066\n$\n25,993\nGoogle Cloud\n(1,243)\n(890)\nOther Bets\n(1,136)\n(1,450)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(1,036)\n(1,768)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n15,651\n$\n21,885\nChange in the useful lives of our server and network equipment\n(unaudited)\nIn January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021, and the effect for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, was a reduction in depreciation expense of $446 million and $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $347 million and $2.0 billion, or $0.52 and $3.02 per basic share and $0.52 and $2.98 per diluted share.\nStock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\nAlphabet today announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one stock split (the “Stock Split”) in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split.\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the “Record Date”), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\nWebcast and conference call information\nA live audio webcast of our fourth quarter 2021 earnings release call will be available on YouTube at https://youtu.be/ItLfgdDN5oE.

Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of February 1, 2022. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.\nContact\nInvestor relations\nMedia\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz\npress@abc.xyz\n3\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and par value per share amounts)\nAs of December 31,\nAs of December 31,\n2020\n2021\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n26,465\n$\n20,945\nMarketable securities\n110,229\n118,704\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n136,694\n139,649\nAccounts receivable, net\n30,930\n39,304\nIncome taxes receivable, net\n454\n966\nInventory\n728\n1,170\nOther current assets\n5,490\n7,054\nTotal current assets\n174,296\n188,143\nNon-marketable securities\n20,703\n29,549\nDeferred income taxes\n1,084\n1,284\nProperty and equipment, net\n84,749\n97,599\nOperating lease assets\n12,211\n12,959\nIntangible assets, net\n1,445\n1,417\nGoodwill\n21,175\n22,956\nOther non-current assets\n3,953\n5,361\nTotal assets\n$\n319,616\n$\n359,268\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n5,589\n$\n6,037\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n11,086\n13,889\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n28,631\n31,236\nAccrued revenue share\n7,500\n8,996\nDeferred revenue\n2,543\n3,288\nIncome taxes payable, net\n1,485\n808\nTotal current liabilities\n56,834\n64,254\nLong-term debt\n13,932\n14,817\nDeferred revenue, non-current\n481\n535\nIncome taxes payable, non-current\n8,849\n9,176\nDeferred income taxes\n3,561\n5,257\nOperating lease liabilities\n11,146\n11,389\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,269\n2,205\nTotal liabilities\n97,072\n107,633\nContingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, 100,000 shares authorized;

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as  a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax  credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow  management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related  to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the  lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial  Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide  investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets,  refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings  Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s  TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $124.96, $122.51 and $115.15 at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and  September 30, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $62mm, $118mm and $259mm for the three months ended September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. For the nine  months ended September 30, 2025, noninterest expense was $71.7B and Firmwide legal expense was $301mm. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s  adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported  results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 9\nAdditional notes 1. As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provision had been fully phased-out; as of September 30, 2024,  CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $720mm CECL benefit. Refer to Note 21 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the  quarterly period ended June 30, 2025 and Note 27 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated  Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable  securities include end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible  securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s  LCR. Also include other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home  Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025 and pages 108-115 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information 3. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits, resulting in an increase in the funding benefit  reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within Corporate net interest income.

In the CIB, IB fees rose 16% as ECM and M&A activity picked up against a supportive backdrop. We continued to benefit from higher client activity and demand for financing in Markets, with record third-quarter Markets revenue of nearly $9 billion. In CCB, we ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fifth consecutive year, and we continue to acquire new accounts at a robust pace, adding more than 400,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. Additionally, in wealth management, first-time investors surpassed 43,000, setting a new record. Finally, in AWM, revenue topped $6 billion, and AUM net inflows remained strong at $109 billion, highlighting the strength of the franchise.”\nDimon added:\n“While there have been some signs of a softening, particularly in job growth, the U.S. economy generally remained resilient. However, there continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation. As always, we hope for the best, but these complex forces reinforce why we prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.”\nDimon concluded:\n“I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, including consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.”\nCAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nn\nCommon dividend of $4.1 billion or $1.50 per share\nn\n$8.0 billion of common stock net repurchases\n10\nn\nNet payout LTM\n10,11\nof 73%\nFORTRESS PRINCIPLES\nn\nBook value per share of $124.96, up 9% YoY; tangible book value per share\n2\nof $105.70, up 10% YoY\nn\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital\n3\nof $287 billion, Standardized ratio\n3\nof 14.8% and Advanced ratio\n3\nof 14.9%\nn\nFirm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.8%\nSUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES\nn\nApproximately\n$2.5 trillion\nof credit and capital\n12\nraised YTD:\nn\n$205 billion\nof credit for consumers\nn\n$25 billion\nof credit for U.S. small businesses\nn\n$2.2 trillion\nof credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities\nn\n$56 billion\nof credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities\nInvestor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479\nMedia Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n1\nPercentage comparisons are for the third quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified.\n2\nFor notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.\nFor additional notes, see page 7.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nIn the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:\na.\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $124.96, $122.51 and $115.15 at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as  a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax  credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow  management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related  to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the  lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial  Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide  investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets,  refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings  Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s  TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $122.51, $119.24 and $111.29 at June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025 and June 30,  2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $118mm, $121mm and $317mm for the three months ended June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio  measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps inves tors understand the effect of these  items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 5. Second-quarter 2025 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding the $774mm income tax benefit are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item  resulted in a decrease of $774mm (after tax) to reported net income from $15.0B to $14.2B; a decrease of $0.28 per share to reported EPS from $5.24 to $4.96; and a  decrease of 1% to ROTCE from 21% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s  results 9\nAdditional notes 1. As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provision had been fully phased-out; as of June 30, 2024, CET1  capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $720mm CECL benefit. Refer to Note 21 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the  quarterly period ended March 31, 2025 and Note 27 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated  Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable  securities include end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible  securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s  LCR. Also include other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home  Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025 and pages 108-115 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information 3. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits, resulting in an increase in the funding benefit  reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within Corporate net interest income.

In the CIB, Markets revenue rose to $8.9 billion, and we supported clients as they navigated volatile market conditions at the beginning of the quarter. Meanwhile, IB activity started slow but gained momentum as market sentiment improved, and IB fees were up 7% for the quarter. In CCB, we added approximately 500,000 net new checking accounts, which drove sequential growth in checking account balances. In Card, we launched a refreshed Sapphire Reserve along with a new Sapphire Reserve for Business, with positive early reactions and strong new card acquisitions. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees rose 10%, and we saw continued client asset net inflows of $80 billion, with client assets crossing over $6.4 trillion.”\nDimon added:\n“Earlier this month, we announced that the Board intends to increase our common dividend for the second time this year, resulting in a 20% cumulative increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. We also repurchased $7 billion of common stock. We ended the quarter with a 15% CET1 ratio, which remains far in excess of our required capital levels. In addition, we have an extraordinary amount of liquidity, with $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities.”\nDimon added:\n“The U.S. economy remained resilient in the quarter. The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook, however, significant risks persist – including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.”\nDimon concluded:\n“I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication are what set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, including consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.”\nSIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 2Q25 RESULTS\nn\n$774 million income tax benefit in Corporate ($0.28 increase in EPS\n10\n)\nCAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nn\nCommon dividend of $3.9 billion or $1.40 per share\nn\n$7.1 billion of common stock net repurchases\n11\nn\nNet payout LTM\n11,12\nof 71%\nFORTRESS PRINCIPLES\nn\nBook value per share of $122.51, up 10% YoY; tangible book value per share\n2\nof $103.40, up 11% YoY\nn\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital\n3\nof $284 billion, Standardized ratio\n3\nof 15.0% and Advanced ratio\n3\nof 15.1%\nn\nFirm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.9%\nSUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES\nn\nApproximately\n$1.7 trillion\nof credit and capital\n13\nraised YTD:\nn\n$135 billion\nof credit for consumers\nn\n$17 billion\nof credit for U.S. small businesses\nn\n$1.5 trillion\nof credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities\nn\n$37 billion\nof credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities\nInvestor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479\nMedia Contact: Michael Fusco (212) 270-2495\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n1\nPercentage comparisons are for the second quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified.\n2\nFor notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.\nFor additional notes, see page 7.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nIn the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Noninterest revenue was $22.4 billion, down 20%.\nNet interest income excluding Markets\n2\nwas $22.8 billion, down 1%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposit balances and higher revolving balances in Card Services, as well as the impact of securities activity including activity in prior quarters. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas $14.0 billion, down 31%. Excluding the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares\n14\nand $546 million of securities losses in the prior year, noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas up 8%, driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher auto operating lease income, higher investment banking fees and higher Payments fees. Markets revenue was $8.9 billion, up 15%.\nNoninterest expense was $23.8 billion, flat to the prior year. Excluding the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation in the prior year, noninterest expense was up 5%, driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in front office and technology employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, auto lease depreciation and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion. Net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, predominantly in Card Services, were up $179 million. The net reserve build of $439 million, primarily in Wholesale, was driven by the impact of net lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. In the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net charge-offs were $2.2 billion and the net reserve build was $821 million.\nThe current quarter included a $774 million income tax benefit in Corporate, driven by the resolution of certain tax audits and the impact of tax regulations finalized in 2024 related to foreign currency translation gains and losses.\n2\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (CCB)\nResults for CCB\n1Q25\n2Q24\n($ millions)\n2Q25\n1Q25\n2Q24\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\nNet revenue\n15\n$\n18,847\n$\n18,313\n$\n17,701\n$\n534\n3\n%\n$\n1,146\n6\n%\nBanking & Wealth Management\n10,698\n10,254\n10,375\n444\n4\n323\n3\nHome Lending\n1,250\n1,207\n1,319\n43\n4\n(69)\n(5)\nCard Services & Auto\n6,899\n6,852\n6,007\n47\n1\n892\n15\nNoninterest expense\n9,858\n9,857\n9,425\n1\n—\n433\n5\nProvision for credit losses\n2,082\n2,629\n2,643\n(547)\n(21)\n(561)\n(21)\nNet income\n$\n5,169\n$\n4,425\n$\n4,210\n$\n744\n17\n%\n$\n959\n23\n%\nDiscussion of Results:\nNet income was $5.2 billion, up 23%.\nNet revenue\n15\nwas $18.8 billion, up 6%.

Morgan Wealth Management and higher card income. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, down 5%, predominantly driven by lower net interest income. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.9 billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher Card Services net interest income on higher revolving balances, as well as higher auto operating lease income.\nNoninterest expense was $9.9 billion, up 5%, largely driven by higher technology expense and higher auto lease depreciation.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.1 billion, up $22 million, primarily driven by Card Services. Reserves were relatively flat, as changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook were offset by loan growth in Card Services.

Markets revenue was $8.9 billion, up 15%.

Equity Markets revenue was $3.2 billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher revenue across products, notably in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was $1.4 billion, up 12%, driven by higher deposit balances as well as fee growth on higher client activity and market levels.\nNoninterest expense was $9.6 billion, up 5%, driven by higher compensation, brokerage and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $696 million, driven by a reserve build in the Commercial & Industrial portfolio, which reflected the impact of net lending activity and credit quality changes on certain exposures, partially offset by a decrease in the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. The net reserve build was $371 million and net charge-offs were $325 million.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:\na.\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $122.51, $119.24 and $111.29 at June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K.\nd.\nSecond-quarter 2025 net income and earnings per share excluding the $774 million income tax benefit are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item resulted in a decrease of $774 million (after tax) to reported net income from $15.0 billion to $14.2 billion and a decrease of $0.28 per share to reported EPS from $5.24 to $4.96. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”) as required under the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) that implement  the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST” or the “Annual Stress Test”) requirements (“DFAST Rule”). The results reflect certain forecasted financial measures  for the nine-quarter projection period (1Q25 through 1Q27) under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The stress test  has been conducted in accordance with the regulations and other requirements of the Federal Reserve. The results represent hypothetical estimates under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve on February 5, 2025 and do  not represent JPMorganChase's forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\"), net income before taxes, capital, risk-weighted  assets (“RWA”), or capital ratios. The results were calculated using forecasting models and methodologies developed by JPMorganChase. The Federal Reserve conducts its own stress tests of  large banks, including JPMorganChase, based on forecasting models and methodologies developed by the Federal Reserve. Because the models and  methodologies utilized by the Firm and the Federal Reserve are different, the results separately published by the Federal Reserve1 may vary from those  disclosed in this report. JPMorganChase may not be able to explain the differences between the results published in this report and the results published by the  Federal Reserve. This report does not include information on the Firm’s 2025 Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement, which will be published by the Federal  Reserve by August 31, 2025. JPMorganChase's results reflect the standardized set of capital action assumptions that are specified in the Federal Reserve's DFAST Rule2 for each quarter of  the projection period, as follows: ⚫ No dividends on any instruments that qualify as common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”); ⚫ Payments on instruments that qualify as additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital equal to the stated dividend, interest, or principal due on such instrument; ⚫ No redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio; and ⚫ No issuances of common stock or preferred stock A strong capital position is essential to the Firm's business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic  volatility is a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. Capital adequacy and stress testing is  subject to oversight at the most senior levels of the Firm, including the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Annual Stress Test is subject to a governance framework,  which includes oversight by the Board of Directors, the Firmwide Asset and Liability Committee, the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide and line of  business (“LOB”) Chief Financial Officers and Chief Risk Officers, Model Risk Governance and Review, and Internal Audit. 1 Overview\n1 As prescribed by the Federal Reserve, the \"as-of\" date for the 2025 Annual Stress Test global market shock and counterparty default components can be any date during the business week of   October 7-11, 2024 2 Shocks to private equity exposures were not included in the 2025 global market shock component; Private equity exposures were stressed under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario 2025 Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario overview ⚫ The Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario, prescribed by the Federal Reserve, is characterized by a hypothetical severe global recession accompanied by  a period of heightened stress in commercial and residential real estate markets and in corporate debt markets  ⚫ For the full scenario description and a complete set of economic variables provided by the Federal Reserve, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System 2025 Stress Test Scenarios (February 5, 2025)  ⚫ The Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario assumes the following stress to key economic variables over a nine-quarter planning horizon: KEY ECONOMIC VARIABLES IN THE SUPERVISORY SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO ⚫ The Firm is also tested against the following additional, add-on components to the 2025 Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario: ⚫ Global market shock2 – set of hypothetical shocks to a large set of risk factors which stress trading and certain other fair-valued positions ⚫ Counterparty default – the unexpected default of the Firm’s largest counterparty determined by net stressed losses across derivatives and securities financing transactions ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS1 2 Overview Key economic variables U.S. real GDP -

Actual losses from historical events that may have impacted the Firm’s reputation are captured through the Firm’s operational loss forecasting  framework; however, the entirety of the reputational impact may not be quantifiable ⚫ Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external  events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. It includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk ⚫ Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized disclosure of data ⚫ Compliance risk is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations ⚫ Conduct risk is the risk that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the  markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation ⚫ Legal risk is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in  which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm ⚫ Estimations and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs ⚫ Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation1 associated with poorly-designed or failed business plans or an inadequate  response to changes in the operating environment   ⚫ Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks  during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions ⚫ Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate  amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities Key risks addressed in the Annual Stress Test The below risks, categorized across four key risk types, represent risks inherent in JPMorganChase's  business activities. The results of the Firm's capital stress test reflect risks from each of these categories: Risk types Definition Strategic Credit and  investment Market ⚫ Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or  a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk and investment portfolio risk ⚫ Consumer credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a customer ⚫ Wholesale credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client or counterparty ⚫ Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the  investment securities portfolio or from principal investments ⚫ Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity  prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term Operational 10 Risks and methodologies\nTrading &  counterparty  losses ⚫ Instantaneous global market shocks with no mitigating actions are applied to trading and counterparty positions as of a chosen date in the previous  quarter; mark-to-market and nine-quarter default losses are reflected in the first quarter of the projection period ⚫ Utilizes the existing Firmwide stress framework and models approved for valuation and stress testing to measure the Firm’s exposure to changes in the  fair value of financial instruments primarily driven by changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and  commodity prices ⚫ Counterparty default assumes the instantaneous and unexpected default of the counterparty which would result in the largest loss across derivatives  and securities financing transaction activities after the market shock Key methodologies used in the Annual Stress Test Components Forecast methodology PPNR Provision for  credit losses ⚫ Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense; includes operational risk expense and excludes the provision for credit losses ⚫ Product-centric models and forecasting frameworks for revenue are based on JPMorganChase’s historical experience supplemented by industry data  and qualitative model estimation, where appropriate ⚫ Granular, LOB-level projections are used for expense forecasts, as well as Firmwide expense reduction guidelines for severe stress environments ⚫ Operational risk loss projections utilize multiple approaches. For risks with relatively more frequent losses, the relationship between macroeconomic  variables and the Firm’s historical loss experience for those risks are utilized to derive loss projections. For idiosyncratic risks with relatively large  potential losses, the loss projections rely on forward-looking assessment of the risk (i.e., scenario analysis, reasonably possible losses) by subject  matter experts Provision on loans, lending-related commitments, and HTM investment securities ⚫ Projections of net charge-offs, allowances for credit losses, and asset balances are based on the composition and characteristics across asset classes  and customer segments of the wholesale and consumer loan portfolios and the held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio ⚫ Model-based approach reflects credit migrations and changes in delinquency trends driven by underlying economic factors; additionally, models  consider macroeconomic forecasts, characteristics such as credit score, ratings, geographic distribution, product and industry mix, and collateral type ⚫ Utilizes loss experience data relevant to the Firm’s asset classes and portfolios Provision on AFS investment securities ⚫ Projections of losses on AFS positions resulting from credit impairment assumes no investment securities are sold throughout the forecast period ⚫ Credit impairment is estimated using credit migration models for non-securitized assets and cash flow simulations for securitized assets 11 Risks and methodologies\nKey methodologies used in the Annual Stress Test (cont’d) Components Forecast methodology RWA OCI Capital ⚫ Projections of RWA are calculated under the Basel III Standardized capital risk-based approach ⚫ Credit risk RWA projections utilize forecasted assets, derivatives, and other off-balance sheet items  ⚫ Market risk RWA projections reflect relationships between RWA and overall performance of financial markets affected by key macroeconomic drivers  using estimation models ⚫ OCI primarily includes the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans ⚫ Projections are based on estimated changes in value of positions using a combination of full revaluation and sensitivity-based forecasting approaches  for AFS investment securities, pension and OPEB plan assets and liabilities ⚫ Capital projections reflect the standardized set of capital action assumptions that are specified in the Federal Reserve's DFAST Rule ⚫ Projections reflect changes in valuations of HFS loans and commitments pending syndication, as well as loans accounted for under the FVO in the  Firm’s wholesale loan portfolio and any loan hedges  ⚫ Projections capture the Firm’s exposure to changes in the mark-to-market value of HFS/FVO loans primarily due to credit spreads, as well as default  losses Other  gains/losses  12 Risks and methodologies\nAgenda Page 1 Overview 1 2 2025 Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario results 3 3 Risks and methodologies 10 4 Notes the to Annual Stress Test results 13\nNotes Slides 3 and 8 1.

PRESS RELEASE DATED JULY 1, 2025\nDocument\nExhibit 99\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001\nNYSE symbol: JPM\nwww.jpmorganchase.com\nNews release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nJPMorganChase Plans Dividend Increase and Has Authorized a New Common Share Repurchase Program\nNew York, July 1, 2025\n–\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”) announced today that its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.50 per share (up from the current $1.40 per share) for the third quarter of 2025. The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors at the customary times that those dividends are declared.\nIn addition, the Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized a new common share repurchase program of $50 billion, effective July 1, 2025. The authorization to repurchase common shares will be used at management’s discretion, and the amount and timing of common share repurchases under the new authorization will be subject to various factors.\nUnder the current Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) framework, the Firm’s preliminary SCB requirement provided by the Federal Reserve is 2.5% (down from the current 3.3%) and the Firm’s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio requirement including regulatory buffers is 11.5% (down from the current 12.3%). The Federal Reserve will provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2025, and that requirement will become effective on October 1, 2025 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2026.\nThe Firm awaits the finalization of the Federal Reserve’s proposed rulemaking to reduce volatility in capital requirements, which would include averaging stress test results from the previous two consecutive years and modifying the annual effective date from October 1 to January 1.\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase said: “We are steadfast in our commitment to serving our clients and communities, which include consumers, businesses of all sizes, schools, hospitals, cities, states, and countries, across all environments. We continue to make significant investments in products, people, and technology to grow our businesses and position the company for future success. The Board’s intended dividend increase, our second this year, represents a sustainable level of capital distribution to our shareholders and is supported by our strong financial performance. The new share repurchase program provides the ability to distribute capital to our shareholders over time, as we see fit. The Federal Reserve’s 2025 stress test results continue to demonstrate that banks are resilient, withstanding extreme hypothetical shocks while supporting the broader economy and financial markets. In addition to the Federal Reserve’s point-in-time stress test, we conduct hundreds of stress tests each week to protect our company from a wide range of possible outcomes. Our fortress balance\nInvestor Contact:\nMikael Grubb\n212-270-2479\nMedia Contact:\nTrish Wexler\n202-916-3206\nsheet, with significant excess capital and robust liquidity, enables us to be a pillar of strength – in both good times and bad times – allowing us to consistently serve our clients, communities, and countries throughout the world. We look forward to future proposals from the Federal Reserve on stress test models and scenarios that will increase transparency and address longstanding issues with the current SCB framework.”\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as  a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax  credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow  management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related  to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the  lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial  Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide  investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets,  refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings  Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s  TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $119.24, $116.07 and $106.81 at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and  March 31, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $121mm, $236mm and ($72mm) for the three months ended March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The adjusted  overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this informat ion helps investors understand the  effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 10\nAdditional notes 1. As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provision had been fully phased-out; as of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $720mm CECL benefit. Refer to Note 27 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K  for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated  Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable  securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible  securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s  LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home  Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108-115 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional  information 3. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits, resulting in an increase in the funding benefit  reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within Corporate net interest income 4. On January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding items related to the First Republic acquisition. As a result of the  agreement, the Firm made a payment of $609mm to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which resulted in a gain of $588mm  which was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025.

Meanwhile, we saw increased activity in the Markets business. Markets revenue rose to $9.7 billion, an exceptionally strong quarter with record revenue in Equities. In CCB, the franchise continued to acquire new customers at a robust pace, opening 500,000 net new checking accounts and adding record first-time investors in wealth management. Finally, AWM had healthy AUM net inflows of $90 billion, and investment performance remained strong.”\nDimon added:\n“This quarter, we repurchased $7 billion of common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. The increase in capital return was supported by our strong earnings generation and elevated capital levels. That being said, we continue to believe it is prudent to maintain excess capital and ample liquidity in this environment – our CET1 ratio remained very strong at 15.4%, and we have an extraordinary amount of liquidity, with $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities.”\nDimon added:\n“The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and “trade wars,” ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.”\nDimon concluded:\n“We remain committed to serving our clients and communities, which include consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries, across all environments. And our fortress balance sheet enables the Firm to be a pillar of strength, particularly during volatile or challenging times.”\nSIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 1Q25 RESULTS\nn\n$588 million First Republic-related gain\n11\nin Corporate ($0.16 increase in EPS\n12\n)\nCAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nn\nCommon dividend of $3.9 billion or $1.40 per share\nn\n$7.1 billion of common stock net repurchases\n13\nn\nNet payout LTM\n13,14\nof 62%\nFORTRESS PRINCIPLES\nn\nBook value per share of $119.24, up 12% YoY; tangible book value per share\n2\nof $100.36, up 13% YoY\nn\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital\n3\nof $280 billion, Standardized ratio\n3\nof 15.4% and Advanced ratio\n3\nof 15.5%\nn\nFirm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0%\nSUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES\nn\nApproximately\n$840 billion\nof credit and capital\n15\nraised in 1Q25:\nn\n$60 billion\nof credit for consumers\nn\n$10 billion\nof credit for U.S. small businesses\nn\n$760 billion\nof credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities\nn\n$10 billion\nof credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities\nInvestor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479\nMedia Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n1\nPercentage comparisons are for the first quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified.\n2\nFor notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.\nFor additional notes, see page 7.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nIn the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Noninterest revenue was $22.6 billion, up 17%.\nNet interest income excluding Markets\n2\nwas $22.6 billion, down 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. These were predominantly offset by higher revolving balances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity including activity in prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposit balances. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas $13.8 billion, up 20%. Excluding the $588 million First Republic-related gain\n11\n, noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas up 14%, largely driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower net investment securities losses compared to the prior year and higher investment banking fees. Markets revenue was $9.7 billion, up 21%, primarily driven by higher Equity Markets revenue.\nNoninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in front office and technology employees. The increase was also driven by higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, higher marketing expense and the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year. These increases were largely offset by the impact of a FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million compared with an increase of $725 million in the prior year.\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by Card Services. The net reserve build of $973 million included $549 million in Wholesale and $441 million in Consumer and was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.

Excluding the net impact of equity investments, Payments revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:\na.\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $119.24, $116.07 and $106.81 at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition  of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and  for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and  tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management  to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax- exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of  business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures  provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding  Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release  Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at  period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $116.07, $115.15, and $104.45 at December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, and  December 31, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Full-year 2024 results included the impact of significant items. These items collectively refer to a $7.9B net gain related to Visa shares, a $1.0B donation of Visa shares  to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, $546mm of net investment securities losses and a $725mm increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment, all  of which were previously disclosed in the first and second quarters of 2024. Full-year 2024 revenue, net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant  items are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $7.3B to reported revenue from $177.6B to $170.2B, a decrease of $7.3B to  managed revenue from $180.6B to $173.3B, a decrease of $4.5B (after tax) to reported net income from $58.5B to $54.0B, a decrease of $1.53 per share to reported  EPS from $19.75 to $18.22 and a decrease of 2ppts to reported ROTCE from 22% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors  and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 5. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $236mm, $259mm, and $175mm for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively; and $740mm  and $1.4B for the full year 2024 and 2023, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue.  Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s  performance 12\nAdditional notes 1. Reflects the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provisions. As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss- Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $720mm CECL benefit; as of December 31, 2023, CET1 capital reflected a $1.4B benefit.

Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated  Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable  securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA- eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the  Firm’s LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at  Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits, resulting in an increase in the funding  benefit reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within Corporate net interest income 13\nAdditional notes on slides 5-6 Slide 5 – Consumer & Community Banking 3.

In the CIB, clients were active, with IB fees up 49%, and Markets revenue rose 21%. Additionally, Payments fees grew by double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, helping drive Payments revenue to a record $18.1 billion for the year. In CCB, we continued to acquire new customers across Consumer Banking, Business Banking, Card and wealth management. For example, nearly 2 million net new checking accounts were opened during 2024. Finally, in AWM, management fees rose 21%, and revenue hit a record $5.8 billion. More impressively, client asset net inflows totaled $486 billion in 2024, bringing cumulative net inflows over the past two years to $976 billion.”\nDimon added:\n“Regarding regulation, we have consistently said that regulation should be designed to effectively balance promoting economic growth and maintaining a safe and sound banking system. It is possible to achieve both goals. This is not about weakening regulation — we maintain a fortress balance sheet, evidenced by $547 billion of total loss-absorbing capacity and $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities — but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair, holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.”\nDimon added:\n“The U.S. economy has been resilient. Unemployment remains relatively low, and consumer spending stayed healthy, including during the holiday season. Businesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business. However, two significant risks remain. Ongoing and future spending requirements will likely be inflationary, and therefore, inflation may persist for some time. Additionally, geopolitical conditions remain the most dangerous and complicated since World War II. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.”\nDimon concluded:\n“I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication are what set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, which include consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.”\nCAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nn\nCommon dividend of $3.5 billion or $1.25 per share\nn\n$4.0 billion of common stock net repurchases\n10\nn\nNet payout LTM\n10,11\nof 54%\nFORTRESS PRINCIPLES\nn\nBook value per share of $116.07, up 11%; tangible book value per share\n2\nof $97.30, up 13%\nn\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital\n3\nof $276 billion, Standardized ratio\n3\nof 15.7% and Advanced ratio\n3\nof 15.8%\nn\nFirm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.1%\nSUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES\nn\nApproximately\n$2.8 trillion\nof credit and capital\n12\nraised in 2024:\nn\n$250 billion\nof credit for consumers\nn\n$40 billion\nof credit for U.S. small businesses\nn\n$2.4 trillion\nof credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities\nn\n$65 billion\nof credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities\nInvestor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479\nMedia Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n1\nPercentage comparisons are for the fourth quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise specified.\n2\nFor notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.\nFor additional notes, see page 7.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nIn the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net interest income was $23.5 billion, down 3%. Noninterest revenue was $20.3 billion, up 29%.\nNet interest income excluding Markets\n2\nwas $23.0 billion, down 2%, driven by lower rates and deposit margin compression across the lines of business, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was largely offset by the impact of balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services and higher wholesale deposit balances. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas $13.7 billion, up 30%, largely driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees and lower net investment securities losses compared to the prior year. Markets revenue was $7.0 billion, up 21%.\nNoninterest expense was $22.8 billion, down 7%. Excluding the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment in the prior year, noninterest expense was up 5%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including growth in front office and technology employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and distribution fees.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve build of $267 million. Net charge-offs of $2.4 billion were up $200 million, primarily driven by Card Services. The net reserve build included a $572 million net build in Consumer, predominantly in Card Services, and a $282 million net release in Wholesale. The prior-year provision was $2.8 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $598 million.\n2\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (CCB)\nResults for CCB\n3Q24\n4Q23\n($ millions)\n4Q24\n3Q24\n4Q23\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\nNet revenue\n13\n$\n18,362\n$\n17,791\n$\n18,097\n$\n571\n3\n%\n$\n265\n1\n%\nBanking & Wealth Management\n10,154\n10,090\n10,877\n64\n1\n(723)\n(7)\nHome Lending\n1,297\n1,295\n1,161\n2\n—\n136\n12\nCard Services & Auto\n6,911\n6,406\n6,059\n505\n8\n852\n14\nNoninterest expense\n9,728\n9,586\n9,336\n142\n1\n392\n4\nProvision for credit losses\n2,623\n2,795\n2,189\n(172)\n(6)\n434\n20\nNet income\n$\n4,516\n$\n4,046\n$\n4,788\n$\n470\n12\n%\n$\n(272)\n(6)\n%\nDiscussion of Results:\nNet income was $4.5 billion, down 6%.\nNet revenue\n13\nwas $18.4 billion, up 1%. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower net interest income on deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances, partially offset by higher asset management fees in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.9 billion, up 14%, driven by Card Services, reflecting higher net interest income on higher revolving balances and higher card income on higher sales volume.\nNoninterest expense was $9.7 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by higher compensation for advisors and bankers, as well as higher technology expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $557 million. Net charge-offs of $2.1 billion were up $428 million, driven by Card Services, primarily due to the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years and balance growth. The net reserve build was predominantly in Card Services, driven by growth in revolving balances, partially offset by changes in certain macroeconomic variables. The prior-year provision was $2.2 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.6 billion and a net reserve build of $551 million.\n3\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nCOMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK (CIB)\n7\nResults for CIB\n3Q24\n4Q23\n($ millions)\n4Q24\n3Q24\n4Q23\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\nNet revenue\n$\n17,598\n$\n17,015\n$\n14,974\n$\n583\n3\n%\n$\n2,624\n18\n%\nBanking & Payments\n9,268\n8,646\n8,038\n622\n7\n1,230\n15\nMarkets & Securities Services\n8,330\n8,369\n6,936\n(39)\n—\n1,394\n20\nNoninterest expense\n8,712\n8,751\n8,169\n(39)\n—\n543\n7\nProvision for credit losses\n61\n316\n576\n(255)\n(81)\n(515)\n(89)\nNet income\n$\n6,636\n$\n5,691\n$\n4,177\n$\n945\n17\n%\n$\n2,459\n59\n%\nDiscussion of Results\n7\n:\nNet income was $6.6 billion, up 59%.\nNet revenue was $17.6 billion, up 18%.

Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 6%. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, Payments revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Markets revenue was $7.0 billion, up 21%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up 20%, largely driven by higher revenue in Credit and Currencies & Emerging Markets.

The provision was driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to loss assumptions on certain loans in Markets.

That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $116.07, $115.15 and $104.45 at December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K.\nd.\nFull-year 2024 results included the impact of significant items. These items collectively refer to a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares, a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, $546 million of net investment securities losses and a $725 million increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment, all of which were previously disclosed in the first and second quarters of 2024. Full-year 2024 revenue, net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $7.3 billion to reported revenue from $177.6 billion to $170.2 billion, a decrease of $7.3 billion to managed revenue from $180.6 billion to $173.3 billion, a decrease of $4.5 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $58.5 billion to $54.0 billion, a decrease of $1.53 per share to reported EPS from $19.75 to $18.22 and a decrease of 2ppts to reported ROTCE from 22% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and  each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities  is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the  comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is  recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a  reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supp lement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide  investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets,  refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to  TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings  Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s  TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $115.15, $111.29 and $100.30 at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and  September 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $259mm, $317mm and $665mm for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. For the nine  months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $69B and Firmwide legal expense was $504mm. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s  adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported  results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 9\nAdditional notes 1.

As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss- Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $720mm CECL benefit; as of September 30, 2023, CET1 capital reflected a $1.4B benefit.

In the CIB, investment banking fees grew 31%, while Markets revenue was resilient, rising 8%. Payments fees grew by double-digits as investments are fueling organic growth. In CCB, we ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fourth consecutive year. Card loans increased 11%, and we saw robust acquisition of 2.5 million accounts. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees rose 15%, and long-term net inflows were a record $72 billion.”\nDimon added:\n“We await our regulators’ new rules on the Basel III endgame and the G-SIB surcharge as well as any adjustments to the SCB or CCAR. We believe rules can be written that promote a strong financial system without causing undue consequences for the economy, and now is an excellent time to step back and review the extensive set of existing rules – which were put in place for a good reason – to understand their impact on economic growth, the viability of both public and private markets, and secondary market liquidity. Regardless of the outcome of these rules, we have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, evidenced by total loss-absorbing capacity of $544 billion plus cash and marketable securities of $1.5 trillion, while our riskiest assets, loans, total $1.3 trillion. On share repurchases, given that market levels are at least slightly inflated, we maintain our modest pace of buybacks, although we reserve the right to adjust this at any time.”\nDimon added:\n“We have been closely monitoring the geopolitical situation for some time, and recent events show that conditions are treacherous and getting worse. There is significant human suffering, and the outcome of these situations could have far-reaching effects on both short-term economic outcomes and more importantly on the course of history. Additionally, while inflation is slowing and the U.S. economy remains resilient, several critical issues remain, including large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. While we hope for the best, these events and the prevailing uncertainty demonstrate why we must be prepared for any environment.”\nDimon concluded:\n“I get to travel around the country and the globe for our Firm. It gives me immense pride to see our employees tirelessly serve their clients and communities, which include over 82 million U.S. consumers and 6 million small businesses, 40 thousand large and medium-sized businesses – who we bank wherever they do business – and thousands of institutional clients, as well as veterans, schools, cities, states and countries around the world.

Net interest income excluding Markets\n2\nwas $23.4 billion, up 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in Card Services and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in CCB and deposit margin compression across the lines of business. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets\n2\nwas $12.7 billion, up 17%, driven by lower net investment securities losses compared to the prior year, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB and higher investment banking fees.

Morgan Wealth Management. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, up 3%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.4 billion, up 11%, driven by Card Services, reflecting higher net interest income on higher revolving balances.\nNoninterest expense was $9.6 billion, up 5%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, primarily for advisors, bankers and technology employees, as well as continued investments in marketing.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.9 billion and a net reserve build of $876 million. Net charge-offs of $1.9 billion were up $520 million, driven by Card Services, primarily due to the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit normalization. The net reserve build was primarily in Card Services, driven by growth in revolving balances and changes in certain macroeconomic variables.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:\na.\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $115.15, $111.29 and $100.30 at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these  Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and  each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities  is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the  comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is  recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a  reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supp lement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets,  which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as  net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the  Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition,  management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate  net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide  investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets,  refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than  mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings  Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s  TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $111.29, $106.81 and $98.11 at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30,  2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Second-quarter 2024 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to  the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9B, a donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation of $1.0B and net investment securities losses  of $546mm. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $5.0B (after tax) to reported net income from $18.1B to $13.1B; a decrease of $1.72 per share to reported  EPS from $6.12 to $4.40; and a decrease of 8ppts to reported ROTCE from 28% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors  and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 5. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal  expense of $317mm, ($72mm) and $420mm for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio  measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these  items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 9\nAdditional notes 1. Reflects the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provisions. As of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing  Capacity reflected the remaining CECL benefit of $720mm; as of June 30, 2023, CET1 capital reflected the benefit of $1.4B.

Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated  Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable  securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible  securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s  LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home  Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 44-51 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 and pages 102-109 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information 3. The First Republic acquisition closed on May 1, 2023, therefore, the current period included approximately one additional month of results associated with First  Republic compared with the prior-year period. Additionally, certain noninterest expense and deposits associated with First Republic were allocated among segments  commencing in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in increases or decreases to the YoY change in certain lines. The prior-year quarter also included the estimated  bargain purchase gain of $2.7B in Corporate as well as the $1.2B credit reserve established for the First Republic portfolio across LOBs 4. On April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. announced the commencement of an exchange offer for Visa Class B-1 common stock. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa  accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2mm shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C  common stock. Visa’s acceptance resulted in a gain for the Firm relating to the Visa Class C common stock, which is held at fair value.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of  May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for  credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on  modeled estimates. As of June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach.

Markets revenue also increased 10%. In CCB, we opened over 450 thousand net new checking accounts, our 50th consecutive quarter of net new account growth. Client investment assets were up 14% to $1.0 trillion, and we also had a record number of first-time investors. Additionally, Card loans were up 12% on continued robust customer acquisition of 2.4 million. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees were up 13%, and we saw $79 billion of client asset net inflows. Pretax margin remained strong at 32%.”\nDimon continued:\n“While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown. Next, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale.”\nDimon added:\n“We now have a CET1 capital ratio of 15.3%, providing us with excess capital even after the uncertainty created by Basel III endgame. Last month, we announced that the Board intends to increase our common dividend for the second time this year, resulting in a 19% cumulative increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023.

Net interest income (“NII”) was $22.9 billion, up 4%. NII excluding Markets\n2\nwas $22.9 billion, up 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in Card Services and one additional month of First Republic-related net interest income, largely offset by deposit margin compression across the LOBs and lower deposit balances in CCB. Noninterest revenue was $28.1 billion, up 37%. Excluding the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares, as well as the estimated bargain purchase gain associated with First Republic of $2.7 billion in the prior-year quarter, noninterest revenue was up 14%, predominantly driven by higher investment banking fees, asset management fees and CIB Markets noninterest revenue. The current and prior-year quarters included net investment securities losses.\nNoninterest expense was $23.7 billion, up 14%. Excluding the $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation in Corporate, noninterest expense was up 9%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in employees.\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs of $2.2 billion were up $820 million, predominantly driven by Card Services. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer, primarily in Card Services, and $189 million in Wholesale. The prior-year provision was $2.9 billion, reflecting a net reserve build of $1.5 billion, predominantly associated with First Republic, as well as net charge-offs of $1.4 billion.\nThe First Republic acquisition\n14\nclosed on May 1, 2023, therefore, the current period included approximately one additional month of results associated with First Republic compared with the prior-year period. Additionally, certain noninterest expense and deposits associated with First Republic were allocated among segments commencing in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in increases or decreases to the YoY change in certain line items. The prior-year quarter also included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in Corporate as well as the $1.2 billion credit reserve established for the First Republic portfolio across the LOBs.\n2\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (CCB)\nResults for CCB\n1Q24\n2Q23\n($ millions)\n2Q24\n1Q24\n2Q23\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\n$ O/(U)\nO/(U) %\nNet revenue\n$\n17,701\n$\n17,653\n$\n17,233\n$\n48\n—\n%\n$\n468\n3\n%\nBanking & Wealth Management\n10,375\n10,324\n10,936\n51\n—\n(561)\n(5)\nHome Lending\n1,319\n1,186\n1,007\n133\n11\n312\n31\nCard Services & Auto\n6,007\n6,143\n5,290\n(136)\n(2)\n717\n14\nNoninterest expense\n9,425\n9,297\n8,313\n128\n1\n1,112\n13\nProvision for credit losses\n2,643\n1,913\n1,862\n730\n38\n781\n42\nNet income\n$\n4,210\n$\n4,831\n$\n5,306\n$\n(621)\n(13)\n%\n$\n(1,096)\n(21)\n%\nDiscussion of Results:\nNet income was $4.2 billion, down 21%.

Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, up 31%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income including one additional month of First Republic-related net interest income compared with the prior period. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.0 billion, up 14%, driven by Card Services, reflecting higher net interest income on higher revolving balances and higher card income on higher sales volume.\nNoninterest expense was $9.4 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by the allocation of certain First Republic-related expense from Corporate to CCB starting in the third quarter of 2023, and higher compensation, largely for advisors, bankers and technology employees, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $579 million. Net charge-offs of $2.1 billion were up $813 million, predominantly driven by Card Services as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was primarily in Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:\na.\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.\nb.\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $111.29, $106.81 and $98.11 at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.\nc.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K.\nd.\nSecond-quarter 2024 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares, a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation and $546 million of net investment securities losses. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $5.0 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $18.1 billion to $13.1 billion, a decrease of $1.72 per share to reported EPS from $6.12 to $4.40 and a decrease of 8ppts to reported ROTCE from 28% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results.\n6\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nNews Release\nAdditional notes:\n3.\nEstimated.

All references in this press release to “excluding First Republic,” “First Republic-related,” “associated with First Republic” or “attributable to First Republic” refer to excluding or including the relevant effects of the First Republic acquisition, as well as subsequent related business and activities, as applicable.\n15.\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As of June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) as required under the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) that implement  the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST” or the “Annual Stress Test”) requirements (“DFAST Rule”). The results reflect certain forecasted financial measures  for the nine-quarter projection period (1Q24 through 1Q26) under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The stress test  has been conducted in accordance with the regulations and other requirements of the Federal Reserve. The results represent hypothetical estimates under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve on February 15, 2024 and do  not represent JPMorgan Chase's forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\"), net income before taxes, capital, risk-weighted  assets (“RWA”), or capital ratios. The results were calculated using forecasting models and methodologies developed by JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve conducts its own stress tests of  large banks, including JPMorgan Chase, based on forecasting models and methodologies developed by the Federal Reserve. Because the models and  methodologies utilized by the Firm and the Federal Reserve are different, the results separately published by the Federal Reserve1 may vary from those  disclosed in this report. JPMorgan Chase may not be able to explain the differences between the results published in this report and the results published by the  Federal Reserve. This report does not include information on the Firm’s 2024 Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement, which will be published by the Federal  Reserve by August 31, 2024. JPMorgan Chase's results reflect the standardized set of capital action assumptions that are specified in the Federal Reserve's DFAST Rule2 for each quarter of  the projection period, as follows: ⚫ No dividends on any instruments that qualify as common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”); ⚫ Payments on instruments that qualify as additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital equal to the stated dividend, interest, or principal due on such instrument; ⚫ No redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio; and ⚫ No issuances of common stock or preferred stock A strong capital position is essential to the Firm's business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic  volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. Capital adequacy and stress  testing is subject to oversight at the most senior levels of the Firm, including the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Annual Stress Test is subject to a governance  framework, which includes oversight by the Board of Directors, the Firmwide Asset and Liability Committee, the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide  and line of business (“LOB”) Chief Financial Officers and Chief Risk Officers, Model Risk Governance and Review, and Internal Audit.

It includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk ⚫ Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized disclosure of data ⚫ Compliance risk is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations ⚫ Conduct risk is the risk that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the  markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation ⚫ Legal risk is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in  which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm ⚫ Estimations and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs ⚫ Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation1 associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or an inadequate  response to changes in the operating environment   ⚫ Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks  during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions ⚫ Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet cash and collateral needs as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,  composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities Key risks addressed in capital adequacy assessment projections The below risks, categorized across four key risk types, represent risks inherent in JPMorgan Chase's  business activities. The results of the Firm's capital stress tests reflect risks from each of these categories: Risk types Definition Strategic Credit and  investment Market ⚫ Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or  a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk and investment portfolio risk ⚫ Consumer credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a customer ⚫ Wholesale credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client or counterparty ⚫ Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the  investment securities portfolio or from principal investments ⚫ Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity  prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term For additional information on the Firm's risks, see Firmwide Risk Management and the various risk sections on pages 86-154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K  1 Reputational impact is less quantifiable than other risks. Actual losses from historical events that may have impacted the Firm’s reputation are captured through the Firm’s operational loss  forecasting framework; however, the entirety of the reputational impact may not be quantifiable Risks and methodologies 10 Operational\nTrading &  counterparty  losses ⚫ Instantaneous global market shocks with no mitigating actions were applied to trading and counterparty positions as of October 12, 2023; mark-to- market and nine-quarter default losses are reflected in the first quarter of the projection period ⚫ Utilizes the existing Firmwide stress framework and models approved for valuation and stress testing to measure the Firm’s exposure to changes in the  fair value of financial instruments primarily driven by changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and  commodity prices ⚫ Counterparty default assumes the instantaneous and unexpected default of the counterparty which would result in the largest loss across derivatives  and securities financing transaction activities after the market shock Key methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections Components Forecast methodology PPNR Provision for  credit losses ⚫ Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense; includes operational risk expense and excludes the provision for credit losses ⚫ Product-centric models and forecasting frameworks for revenue forecasts are based on JPMorgan Chase’s historical experience supp lemented by  industry data and qualitative model estimation, where appropriate ⚫ Granular, LOB-level projections are used for expense forecasts, governed by Firmwide expense reduction guidelines for severe stress environments ⚫ Operational risk loss projections utilize multiple approaches. For risks with relatively more frequent losses, the relationship between macroeconomic  variables and the Firm’s historical loss experience for those risks are utilized to derive loss projections. For idiosyncratic risks with relatively large  potential losses, the loss projections rely on forward-looking assessment of the risk (i.e., scenario analysis, reasonably possible losses) by subject  matter experts Provision on loans, lending-related commitments, and held-to-maturity investment securities ⚫ Projections of net charge-offs, allowances for credit losses, and asset balances are based on the composition and characteristics across asset classes  and customer segments of the wholesale and consumer loan portfolios and the held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio ⚫ Model-based approach reflects credit migrations and changes in delinquency trends driven by underlying economic factors; additionally, models  consider macroeconomic forecasts, characteristics such as credit score, ratings, geographic distribution, product and industry mix, and collateral type ⚫ Utilizes loss experience data relevant to the Firm’s asset classes and portfolios Provision on AFS investment securities ⚫ Projections of losses on AFS positions resulting from credit impairment assumes no investment securities are sold throughout the forecast period ⚫ Credit impairment is estimated using credit migration models for non-securitized assets and cash flow simulations for securitized assets Risks and methodologies 11\nKey methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections  (cont’d) Components Forecast methodology RWA OCI Capital ⚫ Projections of risk-weighted assets are calculated under the Basel III Standardized capital risk-based approach ⚫ Credit risk RWA projections utilize forecasted assets, derivatives, and other off-balance sheet items  ⚫ Market risk RWA projections reflect relationships between RWA and overall performance of financial markets affected by key macroeconomic drivers  using estimation models ⚫ OCI primarily includes the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans ⚫ Projections are based on estimated changes in value of positions using a combination of full revaluation and sensitivity-based forecasting approaches  for AFS investment securities, pension and OPEB plan assets and liabilities ⚫ Capital projections reflect the standardized set of capital action assumptions that are specified in the Federal Reserve's DFAST Rule ⚫ Projections reflect changes in valuations of HFS loans and commitments pending syndication, as well as loans accounted for under the FVO in the  Firm’s wholesale loan portfolio and any loan hedges  ⚫ Projections capture the Firm’s exposure to changes in the mark-to-market value of HFS/FVO loans primarily due to credit spreads, default losses and  business strategy for the portfolio Other  gains/losses  Risks and methodologies 12\nForward-looking statements  The results presented here contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of  1995, including projections that represent estimates based on the hypothetical, severely adverse economic and market scenarios and  assumptions under the Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The stress test results do not represent JPMorgan Chase's forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue, net income before taxes, capital,  risk-weighted assets, or capital and leverage ratios.

PRESS RELEASE DATED JUNE 28, 2024\nDocument\nExhibit 99\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001\nNYSE symbol: JPM\nwww.jpmorganchase.com\nNews release: IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nJPMorgan Chase Plans Dividend Increase and Has Authorized a New Common Share Repurchase Program\nNew York, June 28, 2024\n–\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) announced today that its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $1.25 per share (up from the current $1.15 per share) for the third quarter of 2024. The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors at the customary times that those dividends are declared.\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized a new common share repurchase program of $30 billion, effective July 1, 2024. The authorization to repurchase common shares will be used at management’s discretion, and the timing of repurchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased under the new authorization will be subject to various considerations.\nThe Firm’s preliminary Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement provided by the Federal Reserve is 3.3% (up from the current 2.9%) and the Firm’s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio requirement including regulatory buffers is 12.3% (up from the current 11.9%). However, consistent with the Firm’s disclosure on June 26, 2024 regarding the potential for higher stress losses, should the Federal Reserve modify the Firm’s stress results, the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement would likely be modestly higher than 12.3%. The Federal Reserve will provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024, and that requirement will become effective on October 1, 2024 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025.\nBecause the Firm's capital planning already accounts for the variability of the SCB requirement and uncertainties concerning regulatory capital requirements, no significant changes to the Firm’s overall capital planning are anticipated.\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase said: “The strength of our company allows us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future, pay a sustainable dividend, and return any remaining excess capital to our shareholders as we see fit. The Board’s intended dividend increase, our second this year, would represent a sustainable level of capital distribution to our shareholders, which is supported by our strong financial performance and continuous investments in our business. The new share repurchase program provides additional flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders over time, as and when appropriate. The Federal Reserve’s 2024 stress test results show that banks across the industry are resilient and can withstand severe hypothetical shocks, while continuing to serve as a source of strength to the broader economy. Whereas CCAR is a single, point-in-time stress test, we conduct hundreds of stress tests each week, which include various types of extremely large market movements. We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with substantial excess capital, and we remain prepared for a wide range of potential environments so that we can consistently be there for our clients, governments, and communities around the world.”\nInvestor Contact:\nMikael Grubb\n212-270-2479\nMedia Contact:\nTrish Wexler\npatricia.a.wexler@jpmorgan.com\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Prior periods have not been revised.\n(c)\nCIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 137–139 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information.\n(d)\nDiversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across CIB risks.\n(e)\nCredit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\nPage 6\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(a)\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a\n“managed” basis\n; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a\nmanaged basis\n. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by its lines of business.\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”), net yield, and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics\nexcluding Markets,\nwhich is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, as shown below. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude\nMarkets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K.\nQUARTERLY TRENDS\nFULL YEAR\n1Q24 Change\n2023 Change\n(in millions, except rates)\n1Q24\n4Q23\n3Q23\n2Q23\n1Q23\n4Q23\n1Q23\n2023\n2022\n2022\nNet interest income - reported\n$\n23,082\n$\n24,051\n$\n22,726\n$\n21,779\n$\n20,711\n(4)\n%\n11\n%\n$\n89,267\n$\n66,710\n34\n%\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments\n121\n126\n130\n104\n120\n(4)\n1\n480\n434\n11\nNet interest income - managed basis (a)\n$\n23,203\n$\n24,177\n$\n22,856\n$\n21,883\n$\n20,831\n(4)\n11\n$\n89,747\n$\n67,144\n34\nLess: Markets net interest income\n183\n615\n(317)\n(487)\n(105)\n(70)\nNM\n(294)\n4,789\nNM\nNet interest income excluding Markets (a)\n$\n23,020\n$\n23,562\n$\n23,173\n$\n22,370\n$\n20,936\n(2)\n10\n$\n90,041\n$\n62,355\n44\nAverage interest-earning assets\n$\n3,445,515\n$\n3,408,395\n$\n3,331,728\n$\n3,343,780\n$\n3,216,757\n1\n7\n$\n3,325,708\n$\n3,349,079\n(1)\nLess: Average\nMarkets interest-earning assets\n1,031,075\n985,997\n970,789\n1,003,877\n982,572\n5\n5\n985,777\n953,195\n3\nAverage interest-earning assets excluding Markets\n$\n2,414,440\n$\n2,422,398\n$\n2,360,939\n$\n2,339,903\n$\n2,234,185\n—\n8\n$\n2,339,931\n$\n2,395,884\n(2)\nNet yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis\n2.71\n%\n2.81\n%\n2.72\n%\n2.62\n%\n2.63\n%\n2.70\n%\n2.00\n%\nNet yield on average\nMarkets interest-earning assets\n0.07\n0.25\n(0.13)\n(0.19)\n(0.04)\n(0.03)\n0.50\nNet yield on average interest-earning assets excluding Markets\n3.83\n3.86\n3.89\n3.83\n3.80\n3.85\n2.60\nNoninterest revenue - reported (b)\n$\n18,852\n$\n14,523\n$\n17,148\n$\n19,528\n$\n17,638\n30\n7\n$\n68,837\n$\n61,985\n11\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments (b)\n493\n1,243\n682\n990\n867\n(60)\n(43)\n3,782\n3,148\n20\nNoninterest revenue - managed basis\n$\n19,345\n$\n15,766\n$\n17,830\n$\n20,518\n$\n18,505\n23\n5\n$\n72,619\n$\n65,133\n11\nLess: Markets noninterest revenue (c)\n7,830\n5,232\n6,934\n7,549\n8,543\n50\n(8)\n28,258\n24,373\n16\nNoninterest revenue excluding Markets\n$\n11,515\n$\n10,534\n$\n10,896\n$\n12,969\n$\n9,962\n9\n16\n$\n44,361\n$\n40,760\n9\nMemo: Markets total net revenue\n$\n8,013\n$\n5,847\n$\n6,617\n$\n7,062\n$\n8,438\n37\n(5)\n$\n27,964\n$\n29,162\n(4)\n(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.
